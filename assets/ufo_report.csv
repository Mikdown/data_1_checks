https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=14/50.394/2.9795    
 
Sun:  It was just after 20:00 and the day was pretty clear, I was traveling towards south, and the sighting happened towards east/northeast, as the train moved away.  The sun was in the opposite side of the train from where I saw the UFO. 
 
Weather:  Sparse clouds with noticeable movement because of the wind. 
 
Velocity:  The train was traveling at more than 100Km/h and less than 160Km/h, judging from nearby highway traffic observed later in the trip. 
 
Sighting:  I was traveling in a seat facing the opposite direction of train movement, and first observed the object in the closest distance in the entire sighting.  I noticed a white, long object (slimmer than an airliner) with an apparent size that for me at first felt like a bus- sized object. 
 
As I was moving my point of view along with the train, the object always seemed static, staying above the same place. 
 
No other aircraft was seem during the sighting, but later on I saw airplanes and their movement is very discernible. 
 
As I moved away I could see only its ‘front’, ‘round’ side, that reflected very well the light of the sun allowing for me to see it for more 4-5Kms.  This view was partially obscured by thin clouds, so my notion of initial size can be wrong.  As I moved away it became a shining white dot. 
 
I lost sight after the train track got lower than ground level in a ditch, and made a curve toward Arras.",2019-06-27T00:00:00,,,

Three red dots were in a triangle formation and disappeared one by one by fading out.  A green shooting starts had been sighted one hour prior, and right after the three red dots disappeared a bright object in the sky was yellow and blinking very quickly, then also faded out.  There were objects flying back and forth that were red higher above these three red dots, and simultaneously on the other side of the sky is what looked like the standard airplane flying by.  This clearly showed difference between the many unidentifiable objects seen as the airplane looked like it had standard airplanes lights while the UFOs were only red, the three dots didn’t move in the sky, the bright blinking yellow light didn’t move either, and the approximate two flying red objects were noticeably different looking than the airplane.  This location does not have frequent air traffic the way it did on this night.

Its about 8:00 p.m. on Sunday, October 27th 2019 and my girlfriend and I are heading home to Prescott AZ from Bagdad AZ (about an hour and a half drive). Maybe 30 minutes into the ride we noticed there was a glowing orange light hovering above the top of a small mountain that was maybe 2 miles away. At first we thought it was a tower light we  had never noticed before, but then all of a sudden the orange light disappeared and the craft quickly ascended. The craft began blinking red on the border of it (kinda like a plane would), but it was random when it would blink and there was absolutely no way to see an actual shape of the craft. The craft flew right over the road above us, keeping speed with us, and then began crossing back left over the road. I started flashing my high-beams repeatedly to signal the UFO that I see it and, in my mind, it was a friendly gesture like saying hello. I wasn’t sure if the craft even saw me as it kept flying left, but then we ! noticed it flies up to a group of 4 more of them! Two were glowing orange and the others were already  darkened and blinking. They were flying around  each other in like a tornado formation and kinda looked like they were just having fun. I kept flashing my lights as I was getting further away in hopes they’d follow me. It worked actually! Well, only two crafts that I could see actually followed me, but for an hour they stayed with me the entire drive to Prescott. I kept flashing my lights to make sure they didn’t lose me and to show I didn’t forget about them. It was kinda creepy that they actually did follow us all the way to our apartment because I really didn’t think that was gonna happen when I initially flashed them, but once we got inside our home for like 10 min and then came back out they were gone. Next time I’m hoping they know I’m chill and they can swoop me up to hang for a bit. 🖖 👽😁",2019-12-01T00:00:00,34.5823,-113.17659999999998,POINT(-113.17659999999998 34.5823)

My daughter and I were driving in downtown Monroe when we saw some flashing lights in the sky.  I thought it was just a plane, but the lights looked more like a cool white LED, rather than plane lights I’m used to seeing.  The flashed in an unusual sequence that reminded me of Morse code.  Then, the lights went off!  They came back on and flashed in a sort of random sequence and went off again.  My daughter tried to get video, but was unable to.  The lights then had a ripple effect.  We were driving and lost track of it because of trees.  While it was dusk, there was not a sunset behind where these lights were sighted, it was a darker, blue sky.  You could only see the lights, not the shape of the craft.

I continued looking and as my eyes adjusted I could see that it was a huge dark triangular object.  It had somewhat of a sparkly dark redish appearance that differentiated it from the sky. 
 
I immediately went inside to get my husband.  He saw the same thing.  As we were standing out there watching it, we saw more details.  There seemed to be lights in the center that were circulating.  These were red, white and blue in color.  We also saw lights blinking at different points on the triangle in irregular patterns.  Sometimes the light would get brighter in the center and the go outwards to the points. 
 
After watching it for about an hour, off to the right a bright light jetted across the sky at lightning speed toward the triangle. After seeing this, I looked around and saw several more triangles directly above where we were and an additional one very close to the larger triangle.  They all had a similar appearance to the larger one. 
 
Just after seeing all of these object I saw what seemed to be small balls of light leaving from the points of the large triangle  The large triangle and the smaller ones did not seem to move at all for a good hour. 
 
We came inside for a little bit and when we went back out I could still see the large object but it had moved and I could not see it as well as it was obscured by the trees.  The smaller triangles were no longer in the sky.

Me and my girlfriend were looking at the stars around 8pm, it was kinda cloudy and lightning could be seen on the horizon lighting up the clouds over the ocean.  As we sat there we noticed something moving in the sky.  The object, about the size of a small star, would move from one spot to one another and stay still almost blending in with the stars.  Also, I saw once that very dim light from the object would be reflecting onto the clouds as it flew.  It would disappear behind the clouds as well.  When it would move It moved at about the speed of an airplane.  It even did some circular loop movements up and down that were way too fast to be a plane.  It would stop completely still and I would put my two fingers in between it to make sure I was actually seeing what I was seeing and sure enough it would move to another spot.  It would sit still for a few minutes and then move to another spot and sit still like a star.  At one point we thought we saw multiple lights mov! ing in a similar fashion but we tossed that up to us hyping it up.  There definitely was one “craft” that I followed for as long as it was around being about 20 min.  Not sure what we saw but it was odd.

At the risk of sounding like a lunatic, I need to share my story.  It was around 1977/78 I was 6/7 years old living in Teaneck, New Jersey.  (As I’m writing my keyboard and extra laptop just started turning on and off by itself and the levers are moving!) I was in the sunroom of our two story home, it had a big sliding glass door. 
 
Suddenly, out of nowhere I sensed something and looked up.  There in front of the sliding glass door, on the outside, was a huge orange flying spider/octopus looking creature that must have been at least 5 feet tall.  I was a little girl, but I do remember it covered the entire span of glass.  It was not touching the glass, however, it was hovering and looking at me.  I was terrified!  So I ran to call for my mother. 
 
When I got to the stairs (my mother was upstairs watching tv) I tried to go up and scream for her, but I couldn’t.  It was as if I was paralyzed.  My legs would not take me up the stairs.  No sound would come out.  I remember very clearly that I could hear the sound of the opening credits to General Hospital.  She was watching her soap opera so close by, but I couldn’t call for her.  My voice was stuck. 
 
But I suddenly had this overwhelming compulsion to go back to the orange spider.  It was as if it was talking to me in my head.  It didn’t use words, but I understood it was telling me not to be afraid, not to worry and to come back.  So I did.  And fear was gone and I felt completely calm and at ease.  Almost companionship and trust and even love? I don’t know how to explain it, but my fear was suddenly replaced with a deep trust and knowledge that this creature would not hurt me.  It was my friend. 
 
After I came back, they told me things in my head that I just don’t remember. I’ve tried to remember to no avail. It was speaking to me silently, but at the time I know I was listening, even though there was no sound.  Also, I can’t explain why I know this, but it was very clear that while it had one body, there were many inside.  Not actually physically inside, but rather many “beings” were talking to me.  Like all of them at once, with one voice in my head.  OMG, I know I sound crazy!  I promise you I am not. 
 
And then, just as suddenly as it appeared.  It flew up, above the trees in my backyard and disappeared. 
 
That night at dinner I told my parents and siblings what had happened.  And I asked my teacher if she had ever seen an “orange spider” that was bigger then she was. BTW, I’ve called it my orange spider since that day, but when a science teacher asked me to draw it when I moved to Florida at 10 years old, I realized with the tentacles on it’s arms, it actually looked more like a flying octopus. (my science teacher called a parent meeting with the principle lol) I think she was truly concerned for my mental well being!  I am 47 now and I still know what I saw that day.  I know I did not imagine it,  I did not make it up and I know it happened.  BTW, when I first looked up your site and started writing, as I mentioned above.  My laptop and music keyboard started turning on and off. I propped my phone on desk and pressed record.  It happened again 5 minutes later.  I can send you the video if you’d like.  And now it’s shut itself off completely.  My heart is pounding.  I can’t tell if I shouldn’t share my story or if it’s an encouragement!  Lol  I’ve never written my story, though I’ve shared with close friends and family all my life.  And while electrical things have always gone somewhat haywire, in that they might shut down…the on/off computer thing and moving levers is new. 
 
Anyway, I’m writing in the hopes that someone else may have seen my “orange spider” because I’ve never found anything online that suggests anyone has. 
 
I would welcome your thoughts and any information.  Thank you",2019-12-01T00:00:00,40.8949,-74.011,POINT(-74.011 40.8949)

My UFO Sighting - This Truly Happened!   It is July 1979 at around 07:00 and I am trudging uphill our dead-end street that is located on one of the many hills in Haifa, in order to catch my work bus at 7:10-7:15. 
 
Suddenly, from the far hill above me appears an unusual object and it flies down towards the left side of my street.  It surprisingly stops and hovers there and I am just staring at it. 
 
It is hanging in the air over the field with a fence separating us and because of optical illusion, I can’t figure out its size, height or distance from me. 
 
I am alone and starting to be a bit apprehensive, but I try to observe it in order to embed it in my memory.  It has an ellipse shaped body and the color is metallic dark red.  There is a line in the middle and gothic shaped blackened windows all around, above and below the line.  There are no ‘caps’ on the top of it (as seen in movies) and no lower apparatus.  No lights are showing on the airship, as it is daylight. Also, no sound was coming from it; no whoosh or engine sounds - complete silence. 
 
Suddenly it flies off in the opposite direction from where it came, towards the Mediterranean Sea at mach speed.  It went from one end of the city to the other in a few seconds.  The airship must have been hovering near me for about one minute and the whole sighting lasted about two to three minutes. 
 
I said to myself that it must be a remote controlled toy, but that is impossible, as it is summer vacation and kids are not up so early.   Another idea I had was that it was an aeronautical experiment but this is not a testing area; it is only an urban city area. 
 
That day I reported this to a professor where I worked and was strongly advised not to say anything about it (remember it was 1979 and the subject was taboo).

We were sitting on the bank when we saw a vehicle's lights moving above the train tracks. This was about 1/4 mile from us and moving above the train tracks heading south east. It had several different colored lights swirling at its front.  When it was directly in front of us, it made an abrupt 45 degree turn towards us.  It was plain it was not touching the ground. perhaps a few feet above the ground.  Approaching fast it came across the slough and we believed it would hit us.  At the last possible second it made a 45 degree turn to our right into thick trees and vegetation.  There was no audible crash and we did not see it anywhere.  We went the next night to see if it would show again, but instead a military helicopter came and hovered above us and Lit us up like daylight.  We decided to leave and hightailed it to my truck.  Driving away a Sherriff patrol car came meeting us at a high rate of speed.  We kept driving believing we were not welcome there.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,,

I remember this date well because my aunt was watching us while my mom was at the hospital in labor with my sister. I was sitting on the couch in our living room watching TV when in my peripheral vision I noticed it was night time in the front yard and day time in the back yard. I knew it was actually night time so I got up to look in the back yard. I stepped outside and looked up. Hovering over our backyard was a circular UFO/spacecraft. It went up underneath...kinda like an upside down bowl shape with multiple rows of lights inside. The light that came from it didn’t look like a spotlight, it was just as if daylight existed under it. 
 
I heard my 5yo brother say “oooooo, pretty lights” and that’s when I realized he had followed me outside. We then started yelling for my aunt. By the time she came outside it disappeared.  No noise, no wind, nothing. Just gone. I was about 9 years old at the time. My brother 5. He still remembers it in detail to this day as well.

It was 3/96, during the time that Comet Hyakutake was visible, so I was looking up trying to see the comet, from the parking lot of my apt complex.  It was around the time of the new moon, so stars were prevalent.  What caught my eye was what looked like stars “moving”.  It was in fact, the outline of a large rectangle, moving across the sky. It had lights around the rim, so what I was seeing, was the moving lights against the stars, rimming what looked like a perfect rectangle.  I followed it gliding in a straight line, not sure what direction it was, until trees blocked it, maybe 30 seconds to a minute.  It was not very high, in the sky, maybe the height of a 20-story building (I grew up in NYC). 
 
The next night, feeling freaked out by what I had seen, I had my roommate come outside with me, to “see the comet”, but I needed to face my fear.  It was about 11pm, about an hour or so later than the sighting of the night before.  Along the same stretch of sky, almost the same “path” as the rectangle, we saw 4 orbs, perfectly round, bright lights, descending slowly from pretty high up, maybe 20 to 30 stories up, higher than the rectangle from previous night.  As they descended, they were forming geometric shapes & rotating.  They’d form a circle, square & an elliptical, all while rotating slowly.  Against logic, I moved under them, watching them form the shapes & rotate.  They descended very low, maybe 15 stories, give or take; I grew up in a 17-story building, it looked like they descended lower than the height of the top floor of that building, directly above my head & still rotating & forming shapes.  Directly beneath them, I could see the space between them, they did no! t look attached at all, but definitely more like 4 entirely separate orbs. After, what I’ve since described as their “showboating”, because that’s really what it felt like, making geometric shapes, slowly, in the sky over my head, about 3 or 4 minutes, they started to move, almost exactly along the same path as the rectangle the night before, still forming shapes (mostly squares & circles at this point) & still revolving around eachother, but each together gliding along that same path, until out of site, by the same trees, moving a little slower than the rectangle the night before.  They were definitely not as high up as the rectangular object.  But both nights, there was absolutely no sound from either one, complete silence.  They were both low enough, that had they been an aircraft of some kind, we should definitely have heard something. 
 
At first my roommate corroborated my sighting completely, there were no other witnesses the first night.  However, we were both quite spooked by what we saw & although she described the same thing I saw, for several months, she eventually started to say it “never happened” or that it was “explainable”.  She never did give another explanation though, she just didn’t want to talk about it. We haven’t spoken in many years, I don’t know if she’d be willing to talk about it now.

I was in 9th Grade at the time. I was out on my back porch on the phone. I always stare up at the stars at night (a weird habit of mine). As I stared up at the night sky I noticed a Large Triangular Object with absolutely NO Lights. It was darker than the night sky and blocked out a large portion of the stars. It was absolutely silent. It resembled something like a Hang Glider but extremely large. Almost the size of the old Stealth Fighters, but again was completely Silent and void of any light.

Details of the sighting:   
 
1. The UFO sighted did not make any noise at all.  No apparent sounds were emanating from the craft. 
 
2. Total time of the sighting was approximately 30 to 40 seconds. 
 
3. Direction UFO traveled was from SW to NE by N. 
 
4. Place of sighting was Westboro (also spelled Westborough), Massachusetts, USA. Route 9 (eastbound).  Subject viewing the UFO was outside of parked vehicle, standing. 
 
5. Time of sighting was precisely 8:30 p.m., EST. Date was March 31, 2000. 
 
6. Weather was clear night, no precipitation, no fog. 
 
7. Size of craft to best of knowledge and estimation was 150 feet from tip to base. 
 
8. It was a singular UFO, but its shape was three seemingly attached triangles, forming one triangle with the center absent. The best example of its appearance is to say it looked exactly like the Zelda symbol, only without the foot portion, only the triangle(s). 
 
9. I can attest this is not a joke. This is an actual sighting. 
 
 Extended info: There was absolutely no sound coming from the craft. As an additional note, the UFO almost seemed to be distorted in a way that made it appear as though it were ""fading"" in and out of sight, but not completely out of sight...almost a ""blinking"", but not as timely and synchronized as blinking. There was absolutely no cloud cover, fog, or other means by which this may have been the cause. I have in fact seen a similar object a few weeks prior, but it is insignificant compared to this. But for comparison purposes, the craft seen before this sighting was only visible for approximately 10 seconds at very high altitudes, and appeared to look like an orange glowing bird-like craft, headed directly upward out of viewing range.

I feel a bit silly reporting this event now, as it happened sometime around the year 2003.  My daughter and I were in the car driving down a dirt road very early in the morning.  Our speed was around 20-25 mph.  It was a long straight road with clear fields on each side.  In the distance, a mile or so, there was a bank of tall poplar trees on one side.  The road ran north to south, the trees east to west. We were delivering flowers to a remote ranch and driving north towards the trees.   Suddenly I saw or sensed something to my left and turned to see an object, perhaps twice the size of my car just feet away from us, flying along with us.  The object was so close I feared I could swerve just slightly and hit it.  I tried to keep my eyes on the road but was a bit mezmorized by it and wanted to watch it.   There were no windows that we could see, it was a dark dirty gray, not shiny and the metal seemed a bit ruddy.  There were wide metal strips and there w! ere circles on the strips.  It looked heavy.  I continued to drive and felt a bit panicked because it was so close and I wanted to keep looking at it but also stay on the road.  It flew along side of us for a half mile, at least, maybe more. 
 
Suddenly it took off.  So fast, I cannot possibly calculate.  It was headed right for those trees and I thought for a second it was going to crash into the Poplars but instead it’s path curved up and over disappearing beyond the trees.  We never saw it again.  Once it had disappeared, my attention turned to my daughter sitting in the passenger seat.  My daughter had always been terrified of any mention of aliens from outer space   She had, for years been terrified of the movie, ET.  I slammed on the breaks and turned to her. I said, “are you okay?”  She answered, “I feel safe.”  I found this to be a curious and interesting response. 
 
We continued a few miles down the road and delivered the flowers , then drove home.  I called my brother and told him of the experience.  He suggested we go into separate rooms and draw what we had seen then compare our drawings.  We did this and the results were interesting.  We had indeed drawn the same image, but more than just the image we had both colored our UFO drawing the color orange.  The object was a dark gray and I cannot explain why I picked up the orange crayon. 
 
For reasons that need not be explained, I became separated from my daughter for 14 years.  We recently were re-united.  After spending a day together, I asked her if she remembered seeing the UFO and she did, she remembered it in great detail, the trees, and the way it gracefully curved up and over.  She told me the whole story as if it had happened yesterday.  In all these years since, I have never told anyone, except my brother, about the event.  Who would believe such a story?  But, it’s true and it was a comfort to hear my daughter recall it exactly as I had remembered that morning.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,38.9931,-105.0603,POINT(-105.0603 38.9931)

My sighting happened when I was about 7 or 8 years old.  This happened in 2004 around the time of the string of hurricanes hitting central Florida.  My father, brother and I went to get sandbags to prepare for the storms. 
 
On our way back home (around 8pm) I was looking out the window and saw a silent black object in the shape of the classic saucer silhouetted to the night sky with a band around the middle of it with square sections.  Kind of like this. ([][][][][])  This section of the craft emitted light.  Whitish/yellow maybe orange (i forget it's been almost 16 years)But the lights seemed to be chasing itself every other 2 squares.  The lights moved quickly but the craft itself was still.  (the craft reminds me of Alpha 5's head from Power Rangers, best way I can describe it visually)  When I saw it I was stunned and in a state of shock, I couldn't look away, I felt this uncomfortable feeling as if it knew I was watching it, which I think it knew.  I was tapping my brother on the shoulder and telling him, ""Look out the window there's a ufo!"" he thought I was joking so I stopped looking at it so I could get my brothers attention and when he finally looked out it was gone.  I looked out my window and the back window and it was completely gone.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,,

Two of us were standing around a bonfire on the ice last Friday evening (January 2, 2009). There were quite a few ice fishermen out on Lake Owasso but most people were in their ice houses. The sky was cloudy as is typical in winter, except that the horizons were clear just a little over the tree tops. I was facing west and my buddy west/northwest.  As we stood around talking, something caught my eye just above us and to the south. I looked up expecting to see a shooting star. Instead it was a green-ish/blue-ish egg shaped light streaking through the clouds. It lasted for about three seconds and then vanished.  I initially thought that it was a shooting star because of the speed that the light moved across the sky.  I immediately concluded that it was not a shooting star because the dense clouds overhead prohibited our view of any stars.  Winter clouds in Minnesota are low to the ground and shooting stars occur high in the atmosphere. 
 
 The light appeared to be the size of a large airplane (like a military cargo plane) but it was tough to gauge its size because it was hard to judge distance between the clouds and the ground. 
 
 After initially thinking that the light was a shooting star, my next conclusion was that it was a flare. However, the light was much bigger than a flare, and was traveling horizontally at a constant rate and altitude. Flares also don’t travel as fast as a shooting star. The light also did not look like any flare that I’ve ever seen and was not red or white. 
 
 The light was moving just inside of the clouds. I could see bits of cloud between myself and the light. This makes me think that it wasn’t a flash light, strobe, or other projection onto the clouds since that type of light would not penetrate the clouds. It would reflect off of the clouds and not appear to be inside of the clouds as this light happened to be. It also did not have any of the normal attributes of northern lights, and appeared in the sky just to the south of our position. 
 
 There was no noise created by the light, no trail of clouds or exhaust, and it disappeared just before reaching a clearing in the clouds. I suppose that it could have been some sort of bright gas ball, but I’ve never seen anything like that before. This light shot through the clouds and seemed to have defined edges (egg-shaped). The light never changed direction, speed, or altitude that I could tell. It just vanished at a certain point. 
 
 I can’t say that it was a craft of any sort because all that we saw was a fast moving light. Instantly though, we both knew that we had seen something odd. I don’t have an explanation for what we saw but can describe it quite well. My fishing buddy saw it for the last second or so and couldn’t come up with a good explanation for what we saw either.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,45.0822,-93.139,POINT(-93.139 45.0822)

My friend and I used to hang out nearly every day and as young teenagers tend to do, we would stay up into the wee hours of the night. We were in my friends basement one night watching a movie and all of a sudden there was a rumbling. Not a rumbling akin to an earthquake but more like if you live near a subway or airport. About twenty seconds after the rumbling started we started hearing a whistling noise that sounded almost exactly like the old sound clips they would play when dropping a bomb or heavy object. Naturally we were on high alert as were the dogs he had, they were going absolutely nuts. About ten seconds after we started to hear the whistling noise we saw a craft no more than 40 feet off the ground, right above the tree line. We watched the craft slowly hover away at a speed that you could keep up on a bicycle. We both have this very, very strange feeling, all the hairs standing up, the kind of feeling when you know *something* is wrong but don’t! know what exactly. 
 
 At this point we are absolutely terrified and decide to pack up and move into my friend’s room (the next room over from where we were watching the movie) In the process of picking up or pillows and popcorn my friend was frozen, like a deer in headlights, staring out the window. He didn’t point, didn’t move, hardly reacted and quietly told me to look out the window. As I drew closer to the window I could see there clear as day what appeared to be a man staring back in at us. He looked like your average Joe except that you could see through him as if he was a ghost. I quickly pulled the shades and we both ran into his room and didn’t speak about the encounter ever again.

It sounded like very heavy footsteps, coming from every direction. 
 
We alerted our next door neighbors. Shortly after, around 10 neighbors had gathered outside in our driveway.  All discussing what might be happening in the woods. 
 
Some of which even loaded their firearms in preparation, as we were all under the assumption it was some type of large wild animals. 
 
As they were all talking, I looked up into the sky and immediately noticed what appeared to be two ""small circular balls"" of bright  flickering light, although the changing pattern they were moving in made their actual shape  indistinguishable. 
 
The color of light was 90% bright white similar to a star.  But there were also (somewhat difficult to see), multi colored specs flickering rapidly in it as well. 
 
The MOST alarming part of it was the way the two lights were moving. I can only describe it as the way a bumble bee hovers in place. stationary, yet continually moving up, down, left, right. Only much more quickly and rapidly. 
 
 The lights had almost no change in the 3 hours we watched, EXCEPT; Several times throughout, the two did move to a slightly different position in the sky, (left/right reposition not closer or further away). This happened Very quickly and in sync, It appeared Almost like they were orbiting around each other. 
 
Once, immediately after we witnessed a change in position, one of them began to drop smaller lights out, (approximately 5-10 smaller lights). The lights fell directly downward and each faded out, one after the next, only seconds after they  began to drop. 
 
  The next day we searched the surrounding woods in the light for prints of what it may have been. There did not seem to even be disturbed or crushed leaves anywhere. I do want to add that we found a few clusters of some small (penny sized) circular holes in some parts of the forest. Also some broken/bent  branches around shoulder/waist height. Not enough known facts to determine if they were related to the prior night's incident or not. 
 
 We never experienced the lights disappearing that night. After about 3 hours, We all decided to quit observing because it was so late, we called it a night and went back inside. Days later I found out others living miles away had also heard the same loud noises in their woods that night as well.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,33.7346,-81.0935,POINT(-81.0935 33.7346)

The silver began to expand until a long oval shaped craft was visible.

Sometime during the summer of 2011. I was coming back from hiking in the hills with my uncle and cousin.  The sky was a dark blue.  We were resting at the last hill due north of our village, when my cousin told us to look up.  When we did, I saw a pure white disk in the sky (with a smaller circle in the center, sort of like a ring).  It seemed to be made of a white metal, it was not reflective. It was about the size of a quarter if you hold it up to the sky.  Not sure how high it was, but it was high.  It did this sort of twirl or something, like it stayed in one place but moved someway.  After that it just instantly vanished.  Disappeared.  We couldn’t believe our eyes and ran home to tell our families.  Event lasted about 4 seconds. 
 
This is the crazy part. In the summer of 2013, I saw the same exact craft in approximately the same area.  I was in a field when I saw it moving towards the sun to the west.  There were large golden clouds guarding the sun, and the craft bobbed towards them.  After about 40 seconds, it disappeared in the clouds.  The craft was pretty much the same color as the clouds, and I therefore lost it in them.  Time was about 7pm, the sun was low, but not setting.  I know for a fact it was the same craft.  Same size, shape and color.  Again it had the same small ring in the middle.  This means that same craft stayed there for two years.  After it moved to the west I haven’t seen it since.  The ring in the center was the same color of the craft, but it was more defined somehow.  Hard to describe, basically you could just see it there.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,,

Sitting in my backyard having a drink looked out to my right (north east) and looked at the stars. Noticed three stars in a row with a fourth star perpendicular to the three in a row.  The star looking lights were moving towards me, (heading west towards San Antonio, TX, pretty much right down I-35 south bound. As I stared I couldn’t believe what I was seeing so I ran inside and grabbed my roommate who was cooking in our kitchen. I ran him outside and pointed and said “What is that?!” He squinted for a few seconds and confused under his breath said, “that’s..that’s a UFO”. The object continued towards us, over our heads and then towards the city lights on the horizon of San Antonio. There are two Air Force bases in San Antonio, one of which was near by our house we rented, but the craft was silent, moving way too slow to be an airplane and when it got close enough it just looked like a triangle that was pure black.

When I was about 7 or 8 years old, I had what I thought was a very strange and scary dream. I dreamt about a group of about six blurry figures standing around me. I could make out that the figures were a pale tan-ish color, with larger than normal eyes, and frail physiques. I tried to raise my arm to push them away, but I could not move. Then, the figures moved a large device next to my cheek and I remember hearing what sounded like the whir of a saw blade, and I blacked out. I woke up again, still in the same area, but this time there were only two figures that I could see. One was bending over to look at me, whereas the other was doing something to another device around my right hand. I then blacked out once more, but this time I woke up back in my bed. When I looked around my room, one of the windows was almost fully open, excluding the screen. the next day, I woke up to a series of bumps on my right hand, before the knuckle of my middle finger. When I ch! ecked my left cheek, I noticed about five large dots that form an almost perfect 90 degree angle. there are also four more similar dots on the left side of my neck that can also for a 45 degree angle. Both of these are still on my body and mostly visible.

Late one night while I was in high school, I was leaving a friends house and driving on a remote back road to get home. Upon rounding a corner on the back road a Bright-Glowing red object was exposed in the sky. I could not estimate how far this object was away from me but I pulled over to look at it. It appeared to be the size of the moon, so it was likely within miles of me. The red light coming off this object was glowing and radiant, it looked really amazing. After about 2 or 3 minutes of watching this object, it rapidly accelerated over the horizon. When I say it rapidly accelerated over the horizon, I mean it covered at least 30 miles within about 2 seconds. That's when I knew what I saw was abnormal. The next day, I was obviously excited and was telling everybody. Most people didn't believe me, or just dismissed it. However, when I told my dad he explained to me that his co-worker had told him that morning about how he had seen it too. I have worked i! n the aviation field for years now and still haven't found a good explanation for this sighting.

I saw the creature dart into the woods and the object eventually just disappeared from sight.

Now coming to main plot ,the sky was pretty clear but on my way down i can see few thunderstorm lightning clouds with no sound coming from few mountains.I childishly try to pray my entity oh god plz hear my thoughts and give me some visit.  On my way back i stop near the window glass as the lightning clouds just started hovering above me ,the next moment i see ""black colour perfectly round shape ufo with 9 blue dots and one blue light at centre"",as i am seeing this i pause for a moment as if i am seeing some ghost/god/extraterrestial being in shock,in disbelief i tried to close my eye but can't but after the ray slowly disappear i am able to close my eye and look down and again move my head to look up,but there was the cloud again . 
 
I run quickly to my room-mates and explain them in hurry and call them to down to saw them,unfortunately they only able to see the moving cloud with light blue strokes but no sound.Later it got passed above out roof and went to other side in normal speed as if it was examining something.Nobody beliefs me in my room but agreed to the fast moving cloud. 
 
I was not on any drugs,it was a real experience atleast for me,dont know why they selected me ,maybe because i was too depressed and this was it to be my turning point but dont know after few days later i started to see few rings in my (dream/more of my counscious try to convience me that our imagination lies beyond our limits )of different colours and i have to pass through it to reach a blue field of mazes where i have the capbility to fly in almost high speed ,it like i am chasing somebody /exploring the beauty between diff. blue cubes but in reality all these happens the whole night untill the caretaker woke me up in 6 am in morning. 
 
The next day i have to wake few long distance for some marketing and due to more humidity climate there,air normally flows but that day the air passing through my hands felt different ,as if i was controlling the air directions,i too felt too obscure that moment later deep inside i started to belief in the contact with me. 
 
Next encounter happen in close room with many students inside and all fans turned off due to the air conditioner running and some ppt. being shown in projector,i don't know why tried to use my powers to move the blade of fan due to boredom and to my disbelief it did and came infront of the projector screen,i still didn't belief it was me as if i have the ""telekenesis powers"".Later with time the powers faded away but i can still feel inside me ...",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,,

It was running parallel in the woods beside at 50 and then shot above the tree tops and in a blur it took off at an incline and went out of sight. We were both scared.

 The website asked for input from others who might be able to solve the question of the light source. As a result, I provided a full recounting of my experience. That was two weeks ago and I've not heard any feedback. 
 
 My questions are: was any source/explanation ever found? Did your observatory cameras pick up anything? Is any follow up planned? Did anyone else report the incident?

One night about two years ago, my mother,sister, and I went to a local KFC/Taco Bell next to a Home Depot along the I-95 highway. we went in a truck and I was young and wanted to ride in the truck bed, so I did. We were in line at the drive through, and as I was laying down face-up, I saw a single circle-shaped white object that looked like it was emitting a faint white glow. The object entered my field of view from almost directly South, going North by North-West. After about 1 to 2 seconds of straight movement, it began moving North-East. We were nearby to an airport at the time and I knew all the types of aircraft that flew in the area, along with their identifying lights. The object was going far faster than any other planes I had seen, and made a strange turn that looked like someone drawing a 113 degree angle, with a sudden change in course at the point of turning.

This is a normal procedure I find myself doing on my late shift nights, especially when it is dark. 
 
Having used my small flashlight and having identified no immediate danger I cautiously started walking towards my car when, out the corner of my eye and to the right, I picked up something that looked like bright lights or a fire towards the southwest area of town near Fort Carson and/or Cheyenne Mountain AFB.  Turning my head to get a better look I saw what appeared to be a bright string of amber colored flare like lights that at times appeared connected and at times with gaps between them.  At first I thought they may have been aerial flares or illumination rounds fired from the artillery ranges at Fort Carson.   However, I quickly determined that they were not acting like flares and too high to be ‘Illum’ rounds.  In fact, they appeared to flicker in and out by disappearing and reappearing for lack of a better explanation. 
 
As I looked harder, it appeared that these lights were above the flashing antenna lights on the very top of Cheyenne Mountain.  I could not quite put together in my head what I was actually seeing and could not fully determine if the object was actually one or many items and if it was moving or spinning (from possibly right to left) or if there was an illusion of movement due to its flickering nature. 
 
Suddenly after about a minute or less of this, the object or objects suddenly disappeared and did not come back.  I saw one of my coworkers getting into her car nearby and I yelled out if she just saw that to which she replied she did and made some half joking comment about a flying saucer.  My whole drive home, which was 12 miles in a southerly direction down Powers Blvd, I made sure to keepe an eye out on the sky, however, I never saw them again. 
 
At around 20:55 hours, from home, I called a local new station’s news desk, KKTV I believe, and spoke with someone named  Tony and asked him if anyone had called in reporting a string of amber colored lights in the sky. He immediately became excited at stated I was the first report from Colorado Springs and that he has been getting reports of such a thing for the past hour from Pueblo which is just south of Colorado Springs.  He even volunteered that he was going to call NORAD and ask them if anything was going on and that someone had even sent video which he intended to put on the station’s Facebook page. 
 
As of the following morning, there were no news reports or video.  I talked to my coworker and she stated that she saw the same thing I did and added that the incident seemed to cause the antenna lights on top of Cheyenne Mountain to flicker on and off, something I did not, myself, seem to pick up on. 
 
I am a veteran of the US Army and former law enforcement.  I have seen numerous aircraft and aerial flares over the years and can positively state I have never seen anything quite like this.  However, I am open to the possibility that this sighting could be due to military aircraft and/or flares. 
 
The lights were bright and amber colored, much larger than stars but smaller, although brighter, than the moon.   There was a slight wind where I was at but I do not know what the weather was like in the area where the lights were.

I asked him what else he wanted to look at, so he turned around and was looking toward the Superstition Mountain(facing east now), looking for a star to pick. While he was looking, he pointed to a spot above the point of the mountain and hollered ""mom a flash!"" I looked and waited and saw the flash, so turned his telescope on it. 
 
 There were 2 bright lights, that could only be seen through the telescope, and they were white. Then a third one appeared and they moved into a triangle formation, after chasing each other around in the sky just above the saddle of the mountain, when looking from Apache Junction. 
 
 Once they settled into the triangle formation, they began ""crashing"" into each other, for lack of better description, almost in turns. When this happened, they would glow bright and then dim back down, and would change color as they got hit, almost like it was showing damage. They went from white, to green, to red to an orange or amber color. Every now and then, one of the lights would shoot off and disappear, and another would come back to replace it in just a few minutes. 
 
 This went on for at least an hour, until 2 extremely bright lights flew in from the south, moving like helicopters, and chased the color changing lights behind the mountain, where they did not reappear from behind of. These lights were only visible through the telescope, but the flashes could be seen with the naked eye. My son was very freaked out, and I was texting multiple people a play-by-play as it was happening, eyes glued to the telescope. I was unable to get any photo documentation due to this fact.

He was seated on his deck facing east. A quiet time since there is very little traffic on his road and the birds were settling in for night. A fast moving object caught his eye above the trees headed directly west into the sun. It was a beautiful brown metallic structure. The intensity of sunlight made it shine and revealed shadows indicating layers of metal. It was submarine shaped only with sharper rectangular edges defining its exterior. It did not have an intake opening for jet a engine. It did not have a propeller. It made no noise. Silent and fast. He did not have time to grab a camera. His cellphone was in the house as he liked to enjoy nature without electronics. Just prior to this siting a bald eagle flew directly over the open part of the yard heading northeast almost at eye lev! el since their house is on an elevated part of the property. The navel base at Keyport, WA was lowering their flag just prior to the sighting. (MUFON CMS 94857)",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,,

While out in a boat on Lake Anna on the 4th of July, I noticed 5 orange lights in the sky that looked to be evenly spaced in a line.  I mentioned it thinking it was from some sort of towers in a mountain for planes as I was unfamiliar with the area, visiting friends from Indiana.  I was surprised by the reaction from the group, apparently there were no mountains there and there was not a logical reason for the lights.  At one point they disappeared and then returned, also changed into a V shape pattern. 
 
The driver of the boat had a high powered camera and tried to take pictures...the camera would not take a picture and then almost instantly dies even though it was charged and hadn’t been used. 
 
I’m not sure of the direction of the lights since we were in the middle of the lake and I am not familiar enough with the area but I do know there is a nuclear power plant on the lake and it’s a little strange nonetheless. 
 
The only other thing that stands out is that the lights looked perfectly round, evenly spaced over a decently large distance without a light halo.  I noticed the lights after the fireworks were over, they seemed to be perfectly still.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,,

After several moments of concerted effort studying parts of the sky, I was ready to leave, but for some reason I had an urge to look one more time and that is when I saw a peculiar object. The way my eyes focused on it, I could not very well tell if it was a small craft close to me or a large craft that I was seeing perhaps 30,000 feet distance. The object was a white triangle traveling in a spiral path away from me.  The speed of the rotation and forward movement was very fast and I remember thinking that a human pilot would not be able to withstand the force. As I watched it, I could tell that something seemed! to be struggling to pilot the craft because it was making very quick corrections and not moving in a smooth or straight line. Because of the speed and color, I lost it in the sky for a moment but then again found it before it moved out of my eyesight range. The craft made no sound and there were no lights nor trail of exhaust. Means of propulsion seemed otherworldly and unsuitable for Earth's atmosphere and gravitational forces.

I was returning to my tractor trailer at a large trucking depot. I have made a habit of always looking up as I have never seen a UFO in my 60 years. Always wondered if they were in fact real. This night I was 15 feet from my truck, it was parked in a row with other trucks that reach almost 14 feet high. They were blocking the flood lamps so I was peering at a hazy, few stars night sky. My estimation was the object came over at 100 feet. It looked like a rounded off square, flying corner first. It was bowed so the lateral corners were facing downward.It was smaller than maybe a Piper Cub aircraft, but not by much. Of course at that time it looked dark gray. Just lighter than the sky around it. It moved absolutely silently (the trucks were shut down for the night so it was dead quiet). There were very week pale white lights at the corner of each downward facing ""wing"". If I had not been looking up, I would never have known it came over. It vanished o! ver the top of the trailers and was gone.

Then it looked like something took a shot at them with some type of particle weapon (looked like a shooting star went right between them). After the shot, they left on a reciprocal course back to the southwest. The shot (or whatever it was) appeared to come from the Yakima Firing center. It was not a rocket, way too fast. This all appeared to happen outside of the atmosphere. I am a science teacher and my son is an electrical engineer.

I did not see a UFO but a huge flash of blue that lit up most of the sky, like a bright baby blue, but it wasn't like a lighting flash it was more like a sunset in which the whole sky is lit up evenly, there seemed to be no source of the light, it looked as if the sky just changed colors. The flash lasted longer then lighting but was still fairly quick. After the first flash I paused my TV show and drew my full attention looking out the window. About 3-4 seconds after the first flash a second flash of orange lit up the sky. The third and final flash seemed to be a weird combination of orange and blue with a little purple, that is my closest description I am not sure it really didn't look like any color I have seen before. I dont know what the hell it was, the closet thing I could think of was that it looked like was a nuke went off just without the mushroom cloud and colorful. I know this website is for UFO sightings but I've scoured the internet for almost ! a year now and have found now similar reporting of this in my town and its starting to drive me a little crazy so if anyone else has seen this please let me know.

Subject: Sighting of a HUGE Horizontal Shadow crossing the  Moon early morning on 1st January 2019 We were enjoying our New Year's Eve  outing at a location in Kuwait called Kabd. I was clicking photos of the bonfire when I saw the Moonrise in the eastern sky.  I alerted everyone that  they must look at the beautiful sleepy Moon.  Initially, all looked at the  Moon but soon all got engaged with the fun activities around the bonfire. 
 
I kept on clicking the rising Moon's photos.  I got so engrossed in taking  photos of the beautiful Moon using my Nikon P900 camera that I totally  forgot I was watching the Moon through a very high optical zoom lens. 
 
Suddenly I saw a HUGE horizontal shadow across the lower part of the Moon; I  tried to click the shadow but couldn't focus and soon realized that the shadow was fast disappearing towards the right side of the Moon.  Luckily one click that I took captured a part of the shadow (in the attached photo). 
 
I would request if experts can kindly examine the photo and especially the  shadow while it was captured crossing a Moon's crater the horizontal shadow is clearly appearing crooked on the uneven surface of the crater.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,,

I've always been fascinated about the UFO subject but was very skeptical throughout most of my life until August of 2012 when I experienced an aircraft that flew over my property... I reported it, and to this day, in my mind, I have still not been able to properly process my experience... For weeks I sat outside every night gazing and hoping to have another experience like this one, but I never did. 
 
 On November 30th, 2018, I underwent my 3rd shoulder surgery and during the next few months I participated in physical therapy to strengthen my shoulder just as I had done from previous surgeries and I was healing very well. 
 
 One morning at the end of February, after a good night's sleep, I woke up with horrible pain in my shoulder. As painful as before my surgery, but I knew that after 3 months of healing and strengthening through physical therapy, I could not have injured it while sleeping, yet the pain was almost unbearable. 
 
 I had not taken any pain medication since the third week of December, but this morning I took a prescribed pain reliever to try and overcome the problem... But, I was about to experience something that could not be explained, could not be treated, and could not be reported for fear of the outcome. 
 
 When I got out of bed, took a pain reliever and drank a cup of coffee, I headed to the shower.  When I stepped into the shower and started to wash my hair, my whole world seemed to stop for a few seconds.  From the edge of my hairline in the front above my forehead, all the way back to the crown of my head was a very wide and very high scab of dried blood about 3 inches long. This scab was as if I had a deep cut that was 3 or 4 weeks old or more that was never sewn up but left to heal on its own.  The scab of dried blood was hard, wide, and raised about a quarter of an inch.  It itched as if it were an injury that was well into the healing process. 
 
 My head was fine when I went to bed the night before, but the morning after I was dealing with something that I could not explain.  I picked at this scab for weeks before I finally got it all cleaned up.  I had no pain in or on my head and no fresh blood. Just this huge scab from a large cut on top of my head that was well into the healing process and now I once again had severe pain in my shoulder. 
 
 I called the V.A. Hospital and made an appointment to see the Orthopedic Surgeon who had performed the surgery on my shoulder.  When I attended my appointment he assumed that maybe I just had some inflamation and injected a steroid medication into my shoulder.  I never mentioned what happened to my head as I feared being diagnosed by the V.A. with some mental issue.  A few weeks later I returned with the continued pain, so the Doctor ordered another MRI to see what was wrong. 
 
 The MRI verified that the shoulder repair that was performed on November 30th was completely torn apart and in worse condition than before the surgery.  The doctor said the damage looked like I had been hanging by my arm which would have torn apart the tendons that were not completely healed yet...  I explained that I had not done anything that would have caused this and he just shrugged his shoulders... He made me an appointment with an outside surgeon for consideration of a complete shoulder replacement. 
 
 Since that time I have undergone my 4th shoulder repair surgery on September 11th.  No complete replacement was done, but a complete reconstructive surgery was performed using bovine collagen patches from a cow to help me grow new tissue... I am currently in physical therapy and hoping to heal up well. 
 
 I truly believe that I experienced an abduction that night.  No professional explanation can solidify how the large cut was made on my head and partially healed in the manner that it was, nor the reason that my shoulder repair was completely destroyed as it was. 
 
 And, that's not all...  The V.A. has also notified me to inform me that it appears that I may now have prostate cancer.  I am required by the V.A. to have a complete physical every six months and I have had zero symptoms, my PSA has always been normal and I have always had excellent Lab reports.  Until now......  I am scheduled to see a Prostate Cancer Specialist in St. Louis on the 29th of this month for further testing. 
 
 I cannot disclose this information regarding my thoughts of abduction to anyone, nor I cannot prove anything...  I just know what I know, and I know that whatever happened to me is not normal, nor is it explainable in a way that would be acceptable other than an abduction.  I just felt like sharing this with you. 
 
 Thank you for reading and please keep my identity anonymous.

On the night of July 3rd, 2019, I attended a 4th of July fireworks display at The Oregon Gardens with my date, 3 of her sisters, and one of their boyfriends.  After the fireworks we were walking back to our vehicles when we decided to stop at the Community Skate Park and hang out and talk etc.   
 
We were lying on our backs in the skate bowl looking up at the sky.  The sky was patchy with clouds with the stars visible clearly between the clouds.  There was no moon and we were far away from strong sources of light pollution.

I have no idea why I decided to go ahead and just start recording in the dark, but I did.  After about a minute I decided that this was stupid and it was time to go inside my friends home to sleep.  I laid on the couch and decided to watch the video.  What I captured was unbelievable. I recorded a landing of extraterrestrial nature, mind you I did not see this happening while I was recording.  It only showed up in the video. I was stunned at what my camera picked up and began to zoom in and take screenshots of the activity. The more screenshots I took the more in dept! h I saw what had happened. I saw myself walk into the craft as well as these light beings who were performing acts I did not understand. I became obsessed and couldn’t stop going deeper. The next day I became very ill and could barely function. I stayed sick for about a week before I started feeling normal again. A couple weeks down the road I felt strange and I had skipped my period. I had not been intimate with anyone for months but felt the need to get a pregnancy test. So I did and it was positive. I started to freak out because there was no way possible and I had no one to confide in. A few days later I ended up having a miscarriage and was devastated as well as relieved. Since this experience my life has never been the same. I want to share my footage and my story with others because I know I am not the only one who has experienced this.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,33.50378574057038,-112.077080174793,POINT(-112.07708017479301 33.50378574057038)

I would think of as simply a star, but at that moment the sky was a clear pale blue and there were no other stars in the sky.  The sky was completely clear excepting this object.  I'm near sighted, so I couldn't see it properly.  It was flying (I reckon) as fast as a plane would, and assumed that was it, but either way, I got my phone and took four photos.  The first, third and fourth photos were blurred and distorted, but the third one was clear.  It is linked below.

I send this in the hopes that you at the UFOCenter, who deal with false reports consistently, can  give me a logical conclusion so my mind can focus on other things.  To rephrase, I did NOT doctor this photo.  The only thing I have done to it is convert it to a URL from my phone.

This happened on July 20th, 2019 in West Jordan, UT. I was in my backyard about 7:10 pm, reclining in a lounge chair. I was staring up in the sky thinking of my deceased mom.  I suddenly became aware of a bright light extremely high up in the sky. I could see it was reflecting light but I could tell it was way too high for an airplane, and a helicopter can’t go as high as this was.  I was watching it and realized it wasn’t moving, but just sitting there. Suddenly 3 more lights appeared, moving and took a formation around the first light, to the left. They all sat there for several minutes when they All started moving and changed formation, then sat there several more minutes.  This went on and on, them moving and taking different formations, then sitting, for about 20-25 minutes. Then they all seem to back up and just disappear.  I did get photos of these lights in the sky.  I watched for about another half hour and they never reappeared, so I started to relax and play with my dog.  I kept glancing up, and about the 3rd time I glanced up, I about died of shock. There, right in front of me, flying over the backyard right next to mine (to the east) was two UFOs. They were flying fast, and were perfectly aligned, like a mirror image. They were white, and they were cylindrical shape. They were completely silent, no sound, no vibration.  I could see them perfectly as they were very low. I was just telling myself “Study them, Study them!” There were no windows. They each had an extremely light bright circling around each one of them around their center, and meeting in the middle of the two, which were what looked like a few feet apart from each other.  They glowed exceedingly. They flew over her yard, their roof, and then they were out of my sight. I jumped up and looked for them but they were gone. I didn’t see where they went but I couldn’t see them  anywhere.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,40.60507291666666,-111.99772760416666,POINT(-111.99772760416666 40.605072916666664)

Witness was on her way home from work and when approaching the first marker (on the map), got a clear view of a bright, white light over to her left. (See the Black Star on Annotated Map.) Object was previously obscured by trees, but as her vehicle made the turn around the bend in the road, it came into view.  She had not seen or known about it before getting to that spot.  It was moving slowly in an angle to the right but coming towards her.  It appeared to be moving slow and in her general direction.  The flight path seemed to be more or less level in flight, neither ascending or decending.  When she drove further down the road to where the second marker is on the map, that's when it immediately zipped off to the right and disappeared. (See the Black Star on the Annotated Map.)  It was a very quick maneuver that didn't go up or down from there..just off to the right in her field of view.  The other strange part about this was that when it shot off to the right, i! t seemed to disappear while in full view, just kind of winked out.  There were no trees in the way or anything obscuring the view when that happened.  She slowed down and began trying to see if she could find it again but to no avail.  When she continued down the road to the third marker on the map, she saw a helicopter (marked as a blue star) which she thought might be lifeflight as they fly up from Nashville and often take people to the hospital down there.  It had more than just the white lights so she knew it was something normal. At this point, she was about to tum off of 101st when she called her husband to tell him to check his MADAR unit. The phone call was made at 9:33 pm.  She was only a minute or two away from the house when she made that call.

I saw several planes fly through the sky over an hour or so then I saw two what I thought were planes flying next to one another through the sky headed west north west. I had my camera pointed that way and captured them. Planes make a flashing line in astro photography as you leave the shutter open to allow more light in and there lights are flashing. These ufo's left two solid lines through the photo. I don't know what they were, but they didn't look like planes after I took a closer look at the photos. I could see a solid light as they flew.

It was lingering so I looked to my right where neighbors were in their dock to see if they were blowing bubbles but of course it couldn’t have been because the object was definite in its movement and it was literally hovering. I kept looking up at it and then all around me to see if anyone else was out on lake or could see it with me. I kept gasping with both excitement and wonder. I did speak out loud and said what on earth is that? To myself. It then lifted a bit in no apparent rush. It was definitely translucent to silver it turned itself to and then flew away from me and when it was about 200 ft just above my house it disappeared. I immediately called my neighbor ! to see if they had a drone out but they didn’t and it had no lights or wings it was literally a ball. Maybe from that distance the size of a softball not large at all. It was most definitely just hanging out. It was quite close. It was also quite beautiful.

UO Sighting Thursday Sept 19th 2019 Calling this a “UO” sighting as it I cannot say the object was “flying” and entirely different than any UFO report I have heard about. 
 
Left work at 4:00 as usual and came home to change clothes and go for a run down at the ROCORI track as has been my routine for the past number of years. Probably left my house around 4:30 and jogged across the picked oat field and towards the practice fields on the northern part campus. Lots of sports activity this particular day with football games/practices of various-aged kids etc. with a game taking place at the farthest NW field adjacent the ball field and Co Rd #50. At least one bus parked there. 
 
Proceeded with my run/workout routine which consists of push-ups, sit-ups, stretching, mixed between a series of laps around the track. 1200M, 1600M, 800M, 400M, 200M, 100M. I always time the runs all but the 100M just in case I happen to run a personal best. The entire routine takes probably a bit less than an hour as I generally always clock 12-13 minutes for both the 1200M & in-between workout as well as the 1600M & in-between workout. 
 
This day was perfectly clear with blue sky, hardly a breeze (if any) and zero clouds that I am aware of. At least not a one in the SW-NW horizon that I (and others) were fixated on for the next few hours. 
 
In finishing either the 1200M, or 1600M, I laid down on my back in lane #7 at the SW main finish line (as typical) and did my sit-up routine. Upon finishing, while still on my back & head to the North, I noticed a white dot (as it appeared) way up high in the sky which I first figured was a pelican or eagle or seagull as over the years I have seen white birds soaring way, way, up high wile stretching. However this “bird” was not moving much if at all. Again, this is broad daylight, blue sky at 4:30-5:00pm. Definitely the only feature in the sky aside from the sun which was further W of the object. If memory serves the sun was a tad and higher on the horizon than the object from my perspective but not much. 
 
As far as how obvious this object was in the sky I would say not obvious at all unless one was looking in the right direction. Who looks up into the skies anymore anyway… As I watched the object on my back it appeared to slowly travel back-&-forth N & S slightly a few times however my heart was pounding from my workout so uncertain if it was due to that. Being utterly baffled as to what it was I laid there longer contemplating it being a drone copter that someone at the school was flying. After a few minutes of ponder I got up to continue my workout and onto more laps hoping like heck the thing would not just disappear leaving me frustrated. On the next set of laps I cannot remember if I was able to focus/see it as I rounded that SW corner but as I finished the laps and again laid down to do sit-ups…it was still there! At some point as I laid there I made a conscious effort to determine it’s location in the sky and definitely remember noting 3. One being directly over me (possibly a tad south). The other being directly above the school. And the last being a bit to the West of the school. Again these are only from my perspective having no clue how high or big this thing was. 
 
Following my workout (cannot remember if I finished it all or not being a bit occupied) I noticed 2 young boys (ages 5 & 3 approximately) playing at the south end of the bleachers. I desperately wanted someone else to see this thing so walked over to them asking if they wanted to see an “alien spaceship”. 
 
As any boy would they said yes and put their eyes in the direction of the sky I was pointing. I really no idea if they saw what I was seeing but the older boy did say “I see it” and was looking I the right direction. The younger said he saw it too however was looking the wrong way. 
 
At this point I was getting desperate to find another adult to confirm this object so headed out the south end of the fencing as it was the only gate open to the track. I kept searching for an adult or older student however nobody happened across my path and I didn’t want to appear too crazy having no shirt on, all sweaty, and pointing to the sky at “aliens”. As I headed back North towards home I came across a bus where the female driver was inside reading a book. I hesitated at first but gingerly peeked in the open door and said…”This is possibly the strangest thing you’ve been asked but I’m seeing something quite odd in the sky and am wondering if you would also take a look to confirm I am not going nuts.” Or a version of it. Her comforting reply was something to the affect of…”My folks live in CA and see weird things in the sky all the time so nothing surprises me”. 
 
She put down her book and grabbed her smart phone and struggled her way out of the bus as she had some struggles standing/walking. We walked south through the thin line of trees at the S side of the parking area and as I pointed she immediately saw it and said…”Well that’s weird.” I could not see any movement however the object seemed to be moving slowly from SSW to WSW as I needed to keep looking more West each time I needed to re-find it in the sky. She then put her phone up to either photo or video. It is somewhere around 5:30 now. 
 
At this point I was wanting to get home to my son and get his eyes on it as well so jogged back across the oat field, up to the house, into the workshop & grabbed my binoculars which are Bausch & Lomb 7x35 Zephyr. Here is where it gets weird… In my backyard I found the object even further West and should mention it never seemed to change in size, color, brightness, speed, or anything. When I put the binoculars up to it I was quite startled as I can only describe it as a bright, full, Mini-Moon” however was not too convinced of it being the moon as I knew the moon phase was already past full. I then ran upstairs to tell my son to grab his smart phone and come outside where I passed the binoculars over to him. His comment was pretty much same as the bus drivers being…”What the heck is that thing…” No doubt at this time I am ranting about it being a planet of some sort so we both grab our smart devices and start searching for visible planets, stars, etc. He then proceeds to map the thing with his smart phone as he has an ap for stargazing. I found dialogue on it possibly being Jupiter as Juipter is/was bright in Sept. however it kept mentioning we should see it along the horizon at dusk which further confused me as it was no where near dusk when I first saw it and we were still 2+ hours from it. I’m then trying to convince myself it is the moon as it looks exactly like it with gray shaded features and however much smaller and brighter. To describe the brightness I say it looked like a strongly back-lit, semi- opaque, piece of perfectly round, white plastic. Kind of like some of the LED overhead lights we have today however with the moon(ish) gray shadings. 
 
With my son’s ap, he finds the moon is on the other side of the globe. He then says…”I’ve got it…It’s Arcturus!” and shows me the screen which I cannot argue with except…There is no way we should be seeing surface features on a star! With my binoculars, any star is going to look like a pinpoint of light…not a moon. As we banter back-&-forth about possibilities and questions he lies on his back in the grass to steady his elbows and snaps a couple photos through one lens of the binoculars. I take some video with my pad as well making certain to video the surroundings to pinpoint the thing at a later date. 
 
After approximately 20 minutes of searching internet and looking through binoculars my son gives up and I jump in my vehicle with binoculars and head to a friend’s farm a couple miles away as I had called him to see if he was around and could see what we are seeing. Which he could. On the way I call my wife who is at work and ask her to go outside and look as well which she does with at least one co- worker. 
 
As I get to his property he immediately walks over questioning what the heck it is and then I hand him the binoculars as he did not have his own set. More astonishment as he is seeing the same thing in it being moon(ish) however he says the gray markings look like the batman symbol to which I somewhat agreed however more blurry, a tad misshapen, and more squished up in the upper left of the circle. I then proceed to tell him the only thing I can think of is it being Jupiter and read from the dialogue I found on my pad as he is shaking his head knowing the time is not right for viewing it nor is the direction. Our at his farm we had perfect viewing of the object with no obstruction and it is now getting more towards evening so it was even more visible. Again…It is my opinion it never changed size from when I first caught glimpse of it. However it kept moving westward as we were now looking almost due West. 
 
As we are studying the thing and coming up with hypothesis, his father and brother drive in and we hand them both the binoculars. His dad finds the object first and comments it could possibly be a space station. I mention something about satellites to which he says they zip across the sky which I then did remember as we saw them often when night fishing for walleyes up in northern MN. This object is no comparison to those. Not even remotely. Everyone goes away shaking their heads in confusion. Chores still needed to be done. I go home to shower and get lunch ready for work on Friday. 
 
Friday Sept. 20th I get home from work and walk around the property scanning the horizon South to West to NW and see nothing. I return to look each hour or so and still nothing…At possibly 7:00pm I text my friend asking him “Where did Planet X go!?! and this is his text/reply… 8:01pm I was wondering the same thing!! Do you think it might have been one of those weather monitoring balloons? I watched it until around 8pm last night, and it got really orange/red like the setting sun. My brother ** also saw it turn red and he said that he saw it disappear/burn out/go black. Intriguing none the less!! Saturday Sept. 21st I again went out for my run at the same time however with my father who was visiting for the weekend. 
 
I searched the sky a number of times and saw nothing. 
 
Sunday Sept 22nd Since I am aware of 8 adults that saw this object my hope is to have them each document what they saw independently. I won’t share this document with them till we have everyone’s, independent, account. 
 
May not pursue the bus driver’s account. Time will tell.

Ok, so this has been bugging me for the past few days because of random constant reminders I have been having through the my time after seeing something in the sky. 
 
I don't know what it was I saw but I know that I could not explain and have not seen anything like that before. 
 
I live in kind of a secluded house not like other homes but right next to a community park.  I was laying in bed with my boyfriend when his sister started yelling for help to find her dog. Apparently her dog had just out of nowhere freaked out and ran off our property.  I got a flash light and started looking around the property with my boyfriend.  Around 8:43 or around that time (I didn't have my phone on me), I happened to look in the sky at the perfect time.  What I saw was a formation of lights just suddenly appear in a triangular shape (when they appeared they were moving forward) before disappearing quickly (while moving forward).  Honesty I find it hard to explain all together. The only thing I saw were lights but staggered in a triangle shape but a triangle without the bottom line lit up if that makes sense.  There were maybe 9 lights, there was no noise at all. 
 
This happened very fast and unfortunately my boyfriend did not see it.  My sisters boyfriends came back from taking her car out to look for her dog and luckily she had the dog.  She said she had found her dog had run pretty far off near the area I had seen this in the sky.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,33.86895981220657,-117.54791830985916,POINT(-117.54791830985917 33.86895981220657)

Me and a friend were headed back from Rachel, NV to Alamo, NV, which is about a 40 min drive. We were approximately 20 min into the drive, when I saw an orangeish amber orb of light coming up fairly quick on the car in the rearview mirror.  I was thinking in my head of what it could be.  There had been no headlights, it was orange or amber colored, and definitely higher than any motorcycle light would be.  So having gone through all my logical thoughts, and run out of ideas, I asked my friend to look behind me, and tell me what that was. She stuck her head between the two front seats, and it came right up to the trunk of my car. It was a little less than a foot in size, and was just a glowing translucent ball of light. Not like a bright light glaring at you, and blinding you or making you see halos. And not a reflection type light, but like an orangy amber orb, colored from the inside. A lot brighter than a lit up balloon would be. For lack of a better descripti! on. Also, we were driving about 60mph, maybe more once it was following us, and it was keeping up with and staying the same exact speed as us, and in the same spot for several seconds. Not like something mechanical that would lose and gain speed to keep up, but right there with us, and almost like checking the car out. Then it moved slowly to the drivers side back window, as if checking that out, and then just as i thought it might come right up to my drivers window, it took off super fast into the field. Just as it did that, a car came around the corner. Almost like it knew the car was coming and took off. 
 
 This was in an area where there are no side roads for many many miles, and even had side rails at this spot, so no cars could even pull over. Theres no street lights around, and its complete desert mountains all around. My friend saw it close enough to know it was not a drone, and had no mechanical parts. And i seriously doubt anyone would be out there in the middle of nowhere with hardly any traffic just to pull a prank on some car they will never see again. And im not sure of any technology that is just a ball of light, that can still travel around or be directed. Im an empath, and i felt it had intelligence, and was curious. Our windows were decorated with aliens and ufos for the Alienstock event we had just been at, so maybe it was curious about the windows. It didnt seem dangerous, just curious. 
 
 The next day we told many people at the event what had happenned. We had several people tell us about an orange light that came out of the sky, just above one of the stages, and kind of curved upwards before taking off at a high speed. That happened around 11:30pm according to the people, which was close to the same time as my experience. So was it connected? And what kind of orb of light can be seen from such a far distance, and up closer at the same level of light, without getting brighter?  Ive searched online for similar experiences, and only find the sky orbs, but no close up ones like we saw. So I would love to know if others have had similar sightings. 
 
 As for our backgrounds, I'm not sure how much, or what you want included in that. We both have average jobs, and normal lives. My friend is native american, and also a bit empathic. Obviously we are interested in the subject, since we were at Alienstock. We also follow paranormal stuff. This was her first sighting. Im of mixed white nationalities with a bit of american indian also, but mostly welsh and irish. I have had many sightings before. I live at the bottom of the Nevada Triangle, in Fresno county, and there are lots of sightings in my area. Although most of my main sightings were in the 80's and 90's, with only one incident of missing time that I know of. Im in my 40's and shes in her 50's. Any other info you wish for you are welcome to ask.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,,

I was located on the roof deck bar of the Salem hotel.  I arrived there approximately at 21:15 hrs with my wife and a friend.  Upon settling in at the bar and waiting for our first order of drinks of the night.  I noticed 5 lights off in the distance.  They were rounding a telecommunications tower off in the distance.  At first I thought it might have been aircraft lining up going towards Logan international airport, but after observing them for sometime the lights were just hanging there not moving, and after several mins they began to move.  I asked several people there that night if that was a normal occurrence.  The two bar tenders and waiting staff replied no, it was the first time they had ever seen something like that.  The lights began to move off in another direction and towards the ground were they were not visible anymore.  If this was a flight pattern for landing air craft there should have been more coming in intervals, but have after these lights were g! one there were no more lights that came.  From my vantage point I believe the lights were near Swampscott, Ma, and the Salem, Ma. 
 
Roughly seven mins after being there I took a picture of these lights, and then they began to move, but they were going very slow, not like an ordinary planes flight path that should have looked quicker even at the distance that I was at.  This stuck with me and I wanted to check and see if there were any other reports of these lights and I came across your website. 
 
I have seen many things, I am month away from my contract ending with the military and I am Staff Sergeant I’m the Army.  I am aware of the way aircraft work and act during observation Wether fixed wing or rotary.  I also should mention there were no visible indication lights, the normal red-green blinking lights, nor were there any landing lights. What I am describing can be viewed on any aircraft.

On Friday, September 27, 2019 at approximately 8:40pm in Blacksburg, Virginia, I was outside walking my dog on the trail and as usual, looking up into the sky to see what I could see. My first thoughts of the night were who exactly gets to occupy which altitudes in the sky? Because I noticed several aircraft in the air that evening, some at extremely high altitudes and others seemingly occupying various other levels of the atmosphere. 
 
 One aircraft in particular, that I presume to be of the private variety local to the Virginia Tech airport was flying in unusual patterns with a green, white and red light on it. I had taken the time to watch it carefully because it appeared to be unusual compared to the other aircraft I am accustomed to seeing in the air at night. 
 
 Considering I observe a lot of aircraft in the sky, it’s a regular occurrence here in Blacksburg, this particular aircraft was behaving in a way that made me consider the possibility some kind of driver’s education, behind the wheel class was going on? A minute or so would pass as I continued walking down the path and I looked up into the sky again to see the most amazing things. 
 
 There were three objects in the sky, one at the 11, 12 and 2 o’clock positions and they appear to be on fire. They were clustered together, seemingly moving independent of one another but the object at the 2 o’clock position moved around freely, very firefly, serpentine like and appeared to change altitudes and directions efficiently. 
 
There was a rocket booster looking affect to the objects, but they were clearly emitting some kind of flame. 
 
 Unfortunately, I did not have my camera with me but I did sprint in vein in an attempt to get one. By that point, the objects were gone. The airplane I saw moving erratically in the sky no doubt was observing this same behavior and there was an uptick in traffic in my area immediately following the event, so I would have to think it was witnessed by more than just myself on ground level.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,37.24419848484849,-80.42296060606061,POINT(-80.42296060606061 37.24419848484849)

Me and my mother went out on our back porch for a cigarette.

My mom could see my face as I thought in my head ""If that thing starts moving, I am OUTTA HERE"" sure enough as my mom turns around slowly in horror it now starts heading our way. recorded a video and dialogue between my mom and I as well as the craft is captured. craft was a compilation of 7 small lights bundled closely together. craft almost 'waited' for my mom to turn around as well before it started its dance. it would quickly maneuver 3 different directions impossibly before going completely invisible and showing up miles or a mile from last seen area. it did this maybe 5 or 6 times IN 5 or 6 seconds. Moved so quickly even my mother kept saying Why?? lights were pink on outside edges with violet or purple for the inside! 5 lights. its movements defied conventional physics, Newtonian forces would have destroyed anything else attempting that.

I explained to my mother that this craft is the united states navy x-37 - using mass reduction drive together with piezoelectric superconducting material (ultrasonic vibrations causing noble gas to ionize) she understandably didn't know what the hell i was talking about. I explained 'Ok, its meant to refill combat planes on the field, needing those movements and maneuvers not just to get around but to evade incoming fire . craft was with us for around 5 minutes now appearing overhead and a mile away in the same second. finally in the video (video shows craft as 1 blurry purple ball) I say 'Oh i think i can hear it, sounds exactly like an airplane' because craft was completely silent the entire time, as i said that i could see a regular commercial airline start to come around from the to! ps of houses. As soon as that happened, this craft became ...e! mbarrass ed? it stopped moving crazy and put itself on a straight trajectory, accelerating instantly but not going too insanely fast it b-lined until it went below horizon. my mother wouldn't go to sleep unless she found something similar online. which she did amazingly, and only based on the movements it was doing in the video were exactly the same speed and velocity as we saw. by 4 am my mother finally went to sleep content with what she saw online and in person that night. still confused, but happy someone else had filmed it.

I was a passenger on the Ponant Le Laperouse cruise ship traveling with my family from Hong Kong to Taiwan.  My room was at the very back of the ship.  After dinner I was sitting on the deck listening to an audio book.  Sky was clear.  Stars were evident.  Some haze at water level.  It was dark.  Very little light. 
 
At about 10 pm I noticed a circular set of clear lights rotating counter clockwise slightly above the haze and seemingly close to the ship.  My first thought was it was a drone.  I kept watching for about 15 minutes.  Periodically, It would rapidly move vertically--up and down.  I went inside our room and got my husband who agreed it was something odd.  I then used a set of binoculars, and easily found the the flat topped upside down cone shaped thing.  It had circles on the side that expanded and contracted, all in clear lights.  Circles were of different sizes and looked liked watching a cell under a microscope.  Moving, contracting and expanding circles.  I watched this for nearly 30 minutes. 
 
I have no explanation why I didn't notify the bridge or take a photo.  I did think, that I would ask the ship the next day and I assumed they would have seen it from the bridge--- as it was very clearly there.  I assumed they had cameras that would record it.  I did not attempt to take a photo.  Regrettably I do not know why.  I was actually rather mesmerized by this object.  After about 45 minutes, it disappeared. 
 
The following morning I asked the ship's captain if they had seen it.  He seemed to know nothing about it, but did seem interested in my account.  He said the ship's drone was not flying and they did not have cameras that film off the back of the ship.  The bridge faces forward which explains why they did not see behind the ship. 
 
I have looked around online to see if I can see a drawing or photo of what I saw, but have seen nothing like it.  So thought I would simply report it.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,,

I work as an airport firefighter.  My shift starts at 2:00am.  Since, I make this drive in the dark everyday, I'm very familiar with the normal towers, FAA obstruction beacons and such.  On my drive in, near the small town of Crestline, KS.  I looked North and noticed three very bright white lights in a perfect triangle pattern.  They appeared to be hovering in place, possibly as low as 100-200 feet off the ground, but at night it's hard to judge that.  Confused, as I knew there wasn't anything in that area cell-tower wise, my first thought was a possible military helicopter formation with their forward facing landing lights on.  Again, since I work in aviation on the graveyard shift, I'm used to seeing aircraft lighting.  However, these lights didn't have any of the other mandated FAA aircraft lighting.  For example, there were no red beacons, no green and red directional lighting, none of it.  Just three, perfectly still, perfectly symmetrical bright white! lights.  Over the next 15-30 seconds, I had to keep looking back at the road since I was driving 65mph.  Each time I looked away, one of the lights would disappear.  First there was three, then I looked back and there were only two, then one.  Until they were all gone.  Still confused as to what I had seen I was simply looking in the general direction of the now dark space the lights previously occupied, and suddenly I saw a bright blue flash, followed by something streaking to the west as fast as I've ever seen anything move in my life.  It disappeared over the horizon in just a few seances.  That is when I realized it wasn't military helicopters....  I don't know what it was, but it was the strangest thing I've ever seen.  I have not photographs or video as it all happened very quickly and I was driving.

On a clear evening, Big Dipper was very clear, my Dad and I were sitting around a campfire. He was sitting next to me and said “look” in a surprised and alarmed voice.  I was looking down but looked up and saw a very huge formation of triangles.   At first it resembled a flock of geese but immediately new that was wrong. It resemble a flock of geese because of it’s  ‘V’ formation and the distance between the triangles was similar to the distance between geese. 
 
The size was amazing.  If I extend my arm and extend my hand it nearly took up my entire hand.  There were 5 or 6 triangles on the left part of the ‘V’ and 5 or 6 on the other right hand part.  Over to the right was another ‘V’ shape but further away or at a different angle.  We only saw this object for 2-3 seconds.  It was flying from east to west,  almost directly over our heads..  Each triangle was the same shape and size.  The size of each one is difficult to determine.  I drive to Seattle Tacoma International airport frequently and when I see an airplane in the pattern I put my hand up in front of me to try to gauge the size in comparison.  All the aircraft around Sea Tac appear to be small compared to these triangles.  Both my Dad and I seemed to think the object was very high in the sky.  My estimate is that each triangle was the size of 2-4 large aircraft nose to tail. 
 
Each triangle was perpendicular to the earth.  The entire formation moved as one and traveled sideways.  Each triangle appeared to be separate. There was nothing visible that connected them. There was no apparent indication of movement.  There was no sound.  It seemed to move with great speed.  From the time we first spotted it to when it left our field of vision was 3 seconds top.  We could see it getting smaller as it flew towards the Olympic Mountains. We think it flew out of our sight. If so the speed would be incredible.  We regularly see jets flying towards the north end of the mountains on their way to Asia.  We see these aircraft for more than a minute.  Port Orchard is approximately 30 miles from Sea Tac. 
 
There were no lights we associate with aviation. The only light was a white-yellowish glow coming from each triangle.  The glow was contained to the middle in a slight oval shape. Some of the light spilled over to reveal straight edges of the triangle. Each of the triangles had the same color and light amount.

Per usual I was looking up at the sky when I saw a large object seemingly hovering around in the same spot.  There was a weird light zipping around the object that I was able to get on video. 
 
When looking up at the sky there was an object that seemed quite large hovering in a small area. There were several lights around the bottom of the object which is how I was able to see it slightly moving in sort of a circle.  I assumed, at first, that it was a plane, but as I stood there it didn't seem to be really going anywhere.  It seemed to be very high up above the clouds, though it still seemed quite large. 
 
I decided to try to film what was going on with my phone. It couldn't quite pick up the large object even zoomed in as far as it would go.  It did, though, pick up a strange white light that seemed to just be zipping around the sky around the larger object.  This object moved very quickly in a random pattern back and forth around the larger object.  It seemed to almost disappear for a super brief period and then it would reappear on the other side of the larger object in the blink of an eye. 
 
As I said, I did get it on video and have watched it several times and even had my husband and sister watch it and we cannot figure out what could be moving around in such a way.

I often see comets or shooting stars as I sit on a bench on my front porch. Sometimes they are like a thin white streak through the night sky. Sometimes they are closer to earth and are a bright beautiful yellow. I enjoy seeing these, so I will often try to catch them. Last night at 2:19 or so I was sitting and I noticed something above in my peripheral.  I looked up and it is a perfect v flying against the night sky.  Glowing, and I am immediately out of my seat, rationalizing it to myself.  Those are birds. It looks almost like the V birds make but somehow perfect and they are moving totally unlike birds. Nothing is staggered, it's almost like it's coasting.  The light had seemed extremely bright when it was basically over top of me, but once it started to move rapidly away, it began to get slightly dimmer, but I could still easily see it against the night sky. In no time at all the V is getting longer and longer in the distance.  The formation is heading towar! ds town so I can see the shape against the slightly lit up backdrop above the trees and I swear before it dipped below I could see the outline of a ship.  It seemed wide like a saucer but thicker height wise then what I generally think of a saucer. 
 
 I have lived here for more than a year.  It is a tourist town on the coast and there is a military base very nearby.  The Eglin Air Force Base. Basically this town is tourists and military members. I have never had an encounter like this before. I was on the phone with a friend of mine just screaming, ""What is that? That is not normal."" Because, it wasn't. Airplanes fly over my all the time.  I am used to the roar at all hours of the night. I have watched from the beach as the air force practiced flying their jets in formation, and my daughter cried because it was literally too loud for her.  I know what ships sound and look like in the sky, but whatever I saw last night was totally silent. No hum to the air. No roar as it passed by.  I was terrified and giddy all at the same time.  I almost started to cry, because in the midst of this thing I did not understand I realized it was sort of a gift.  I am writing this in the hopes that you maybe get something from around this! area last night, that someone else saw something and I am not crazy.  Even if no one else did see though, I never thought I would get to see something like it.  It was a singular experience that was difficult to describe.

It was a clear night and not a cloud in the sky north and northwest of us. To the South the sky was cloudy due to rain. As I was enjoying the stars, I noticed something traveling at the tree line that appeared to be a huge oblong shaped cloud from a distance. It was traveling about 30 miles per hour and as it reached the front of my house, I looked closer and noticed it was a solid object emitting smoke all over it as if it were trying to appear to be a cloud. The entire time not once did this object make not one noise; in fact, it was very quiet and still when this flew by. 
 
I then said to my husband “what is that?!”, he turned around and watched it through the tree, when suddenly it made a hard left and we noticed a wing; as it floated east, I quickly went inside frightened as I have never seen this before. My husband watched it disappear through a tree line behind our house and got a clearer view as it floated away, he claims it was chevron shaped. It had zero lights on it, and was like a dark charcoal gray inside of the cloud appearance. 
 
I really wish I would have had my phone to take a video, but this thing flew by so quick I did not have time to get my phone. We both lost sleep over this that night and spent hours researching what we saw.

My wife, myself, and my 2 boys were driving on I40E about a mile before the New Hope Church Rd exit at around 7:40pm and saw a cluster of what looked like 8-10 crafts that were changing colors from red to green, blue, bright white, etc and they colors changed at the same time across all crafts.

At approximately 9:40 pm, I heard the distinctive sound of fighter jets passing overhead. 
 
We hear that maybe once a month or so & I often run out back to watch what seem to be F18s or F15s fly by usually n pairs, usually heading roughly south. we live very near Moffett field as well as the San Jose Airport & a small airport for private planes I believe is called ""Reid–Hillview"" for private planes.  The sky is always full of planes, big & small, commercial & military. Google & NASA both have a presence at Moffett. 
 
On this occasion is was dark, night time, a not entirely black sky, very polluted with with lights was full of planes as always. 2 Fighters were heading south at a moderate altitude (probably several thousand feet) they had several sets of lights on. In an unusual twist only a few minutes later a second set was heard. I went out back again and watch 2 more fighters streak loudly southward. 
 
Both times I called my 8 year old son out to see, the second time I called out the whole family. My wife & daughter, not terribly interested took a long time to come out by which time my son & I had been watching a bizarre, triangle formation of red & only red lights crossing the the entire sky from the Santa Cruz mountains, eventually passing over the TV & radio towers on the peak of the east hills. 
 
It took about 2-3 minutes for the formation of objects to cross the entire sky & disappear from view, into the distance. The objects held a distant but incredibly accurate triangle formation. The red lights were not ""blinking"" in a regular pattern, they were alternating in an ever-changing coordinated, often very rapid sequence like no aircraft or group of aircraft that I, personally have ever seen.  There was no discernible repetition or pattern to the blinking.  It seemed coordinated & deliberate almost like Morse Code or music. 
 
As the objects passed over the nearby foothills they took a surprisingly long time to disappear into the distance.  To me this was an indication that they were higher & larger than they had initially appeared.  There was no particular sound that seemed associated with these particular objects.  Usually we can associate the many sounds coming from the crowded sky with the objects responsible.  The fighters for example are far louder than anything else ever is. 
 
There were a hand full of other odd characters in the sky that night.  Presumably & seemingly conventional aircraft with somewhat odd light patterns, always-on bright white lights, more & brighter lights than the usual commercial or private aircraft seeming to circle around the entirety of the silicon valley for most of an hour before/after the strange triangle passed overhead. 
 
My son and I watched this formation from one horizon to the other.  My wife & daughter saw the second half. I didn't go for my camera because I didn't want to miss anything.  Most likely this was a formation of drones or stealth fighters.  The lights were weird to the point that they must have been made deliberately weird.  I wish I had footage so I could try to figure out which symphony or what Morse code message some Goole nerd had probably programmed into the light pattern just to be a smart ass . 
 
What ever it was I didn't particularly like it, less for it's weirdness & more for it's condescension.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,37.43676741573034,-121.89565842696628,POINT(-121.89565842696628 37.43676741573034)

The neighborhood is on the flight path to ABIA, so lots of air traffic, but this was not a typical air craft.

We were on my pontoon boat - we had spent most of the afternoon on Anclote Key Preserve State Park and the Sandbars that are just to the North of the park.  There were 7 of us on the boat.  We left the sandbars and headed out about 7 miles as the sun was setting, towards a reef sight and known fish haven.  Because of the storms that had passed through earlier, the water was rough, with 3-foot seas, we decided to make a turn South and then head back just after the sun had set.  We were pulling a jet ski so we could only move at around 4-5 mph in fear of snapping the tow line.  As we were approaching the pass between the Anclote Key Preserve and the sandbars, two of the people on the front of the boat started talking about seeing what they thought was a bag or a balloon sitting on the water up ahead and to the right of the boat.  We had no lights, other than standard navigational lights on at the time, however, because of the moisture in the air, the city lights were causing the water to have enough light reflected on it to see ahead in the water.  As we approached the object, the 4 guests on the front of the boat were trying to figure out what it was, going back and forth as to whether it was a big plastic bag, a balloon or maybe even a big bird of some sort.  However, as we got closer is was apparent that the object was bigger than everyone though, probably around 4-5 feet across, cylinder in shape and maybe 4 to 5 feet tall.  As we came to with 100 feet or so of the object, it lifted quickly into the air straight up and hovered at around 8 to 10 feet off the water.  It was a dull color, and you could tell it was solid but had no shininess to it at all.  Everyone on the boat sat in silence and disbelief as we passed by the object to the right of the boat as it just sat there. No sound, no lights - nothing.  Once passed, I turned to everyone and asked, 'Did you all just see that?' and everyone was still looking trying to see it.  I turned! on my flood/spot lights, and turned the boat around because w! e all st ill thought it was something that may have been attached to the water and floating, but none of us seen any sort of cable or string attaching it to anything.  After turning around, and making a couple of passes in the shape of a figure 8, we did not see the object again.  We discussed the object all the way back in to the dock and we do not know what it was that we say.  We all were in agreement that it was NOT as balloon, bag or bird of anny kind.  We all believe it was a solid object, or what appeared to be very solid.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,,,

I was visiting McDonald's restaurant last night on Blossom Hill Rd. and Kooser Ave. while sitting in my car in the parking lot with the window open I started hearing a noise that sounded like someone dragging a big bag of rocks across the sidewalk very slowly. as I exited my vehicle I looked up above my head into the night sky.  I saw 3 distinct small red lights in triangular formation that were blinking together but not always consistent.  This area above my head in the sky always has heavy commercial airline traffic.  The lights traveled in such a consistent orientation that it led me to believe that this was 1 craft, and not 3 separate crafts.  The speed of this craft was very slow.  I observed that this craft was also well under the elevation of the airport traffic itself.  I have seen planes land and take off at night and day and am familiar with the mass silhouette of area that the wings and fuselage cover. this craft by comparison was maybe 9 to 10 times the size of a full moon in the night sky. as it passed over my head I was trying to determine the shape of this craft.  I did not see any defining edges to this craft no matter where I looked for it.  It is as if the lights were visible but not the craft.

We were fishing at sunset facing west. I noticed a shiny slender object stationary that was a cigar shape at fist but in a vertical position.

I was at Myrtle Beach with my elderly mother and her two friends for the week. It was a Tuesday night on Oct. 8. The ladies were already in bed for the night and I was out on a 3rd floor hotel balcony overlooking the beach boardwalk. I was drinking bourbon at the time.  It was around 23:00 and as I looks northward up the beach, I noticed Orangish Red lights in the air moving south following the beach. Weather was very cloudy and these lights were below the clouds. There was southward wind around 10 mph. as we were having poor weather last few days. 
 
 I first glance I thought all the tourist helicopters were flying down the beach with a landing or spotlight on. I though it was cool, an evening air show of sorts. But then the several lights started dropping other reddish orange lights from the bottom. Just like them but smaller. These lights descended a bit and disappeared. First thought was roman candles or flares. 
 
 I then noticed there was no sound coming from the objects. The tourist helicopters were loud, and I should be hearing them, but I wasn’t. As they drew closer. Still dropping their lights. I noticed there was no red or green wing tip lights. Just the reddish glow of the objects themselves. But still no engine noise. 
 
 As first one was in front of the hotel and myself, I noticed no white blinking tail light either. Just a spherical light at about a 45-degree angle, below the clouds.  And still no noise. It was at this time I woke my mother to look and see if she was seeing what I was seeing. She started watching the event mid-way through and also wondered what they were and also noticed no sound from them. The objects were still continuing to drop other lights. This entire time. My thinking if these were flares, they would illuminate the ground or water, but didn’t. they just dropped and dissipated. They were dropping light so frequently, there would be three small lights under the main. As the forth light would drop the first would dissipate. 
 
After 8 or 10 moved by the last one in the formation which unlike the others, was not dropping lights came by, and as they moved south disappeared into the low clouds. The objects in front were still dropping lights as I could no longer see them but the dropped lights still appeared as they fell below the clouds. This entire event lasted 4 or 5 min. 
 
 I still have no clue what I saw. I have considered drones, but cannot explain the dropping of the lights. I have considered candle balloons as they were moving south with a southern wind direction with pieces of the burning materials falling off. But the straight-line formation along with the regularity of the dropping lights discounts that to me. 
 
I frequent airshows. I am a fan of military aviation, and I can identify aircraft as I see them fly over. Not being able to explain this is irritating to me. I do not believe in UFOs. I still don’t. However, there is video footage online that is very similar to what I saw. And I finally realized I had a cell phone to record this and I did video the last sphere as it went by. But as I said. It was not dropping lights like the others so I have no proof of that activity. 
 
 If I was to describe this in UFO terms. Foo Fighter seems to match.

I watched it for more then 3 hours zip around the sky.  But it only flew in one side of space.  It seemed very far but I had a feeling the lights were not from actually light but either a jet engine sort of thing.  It's hard to explain.  I went outside multiple times to make sure I was seeing it right. Then I looked to the left and the was a bigger light but more yellow and it was flashing slowly..  it did some wiggles then starting moving straight out to space and disappeared.  Then I looked all around the sky and saw two more yellow looking stars but they did not move or blink.  They looked like they were shinning a yellow light downwards tho. 
 
Anyway that's all, I just feel I had to tell someone professional, I told a few people but they just looked at me funny. 
 
This is no joke, I also saw a plane fly but and in comparison the bright light I saw flying around was way more fast, could stop on a dime and go the opposite direction. And it was clear as day how bright and flickering it was. Id love to know if anyone else seen this as well.

I noticed to my upper left field of view a sudden bright light and that it's moving fast. 
 
I thought it was a shooting star (my thought as it entered my peripheral vision) so I got excited and looked at it and IMMEDIATELY could tell that it wasn't a shooting star.  It had hard edges to it and there were giant red circular lights on the back of it, with some smaller? (really ambiguous) white light near the red.  It was a hexigonal cone shape, with a flattened bottom. 
 
It traveled around the speed of a shooting star, which is what made me think what I did at first. It went very quickly from my left field of view to my right and then made a VERY hard and sudden left turn and as soon as it completed the turn, it disappeared.  There was a very very VERY unnoticable white blink when it disappeared. Very subtle. 
 
So the best way I can describe its flight path was ✓ (but flipped around, and it was more horizontal/parallel to the ground). 
 
There was no sound, no sonic booms, no loud engine sounds.  It was relatively low to the ground as well, no higher than a mid-alttitude plane.  If I had to guess, maybe 3,000-4,000 feet off the ground. 
 
All happened I'm about 3-4 seconds and I didn't take my eyes off of it until it vanished, and even still I kept looking up at the sky.  I was driving slowly along a relatively straight road so with no body around.  So my focus was on the sky for a good couple minutes after that.

October 9, 2019  This morning I was driving to an appointment I had at the VA Hospital in Albuquerque, NM.  My wife and I moved to Albuquerque late last year.  I saw a stationary, very, very bright white light above the Sandia Mountain range at approximately 6:45AM.  It was difficult to look directly at the light.  When I saw the light I was traveling east on the Paseo del Norte (an east west four lane highway).  The light lasted just a few seconds before it ""winked"" out.  I didn't see a tail that one would see if it were a meteor.  I can't say if the light was above the mountain range or east of the range.  At whatever distance it was at it appeared to be the size of a pin head.  I don't know if it was a UFO.   
 
Currently, Albuquerque is celebrating the annual Balloon Fiesta.  The fiesta started last weekend and ends this weekend.  There were balloons in the sky but they were all above the Balloon Park or spread out to the north.  It was no more than 5-15 minutes after the light went out that I saw a helicopter flying south towards the general location of the light.  The helicopter may have turned east, but the distance was too far for me to be sure if it went east or turned west.  By then I was merging onto Interstate 25 going south to the VA hospital.  One thought that occurred to me at the time was that the light I observed was a star becoming a super nova.  A second thought was that it may have been an airplane coming in to land at the Albuquerque airport.  I scratched that idea by the way the light disappeared and its high intensity.  By the way, there were no stars to be seen in this part of the sky as the sun was up on the other side of the mountain range.  I'm sure other people driving east would have seen the same light.  There were hundreds of cars on the road heading to work or the balloon park.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,35.117007033898304,-106.62212966101694,POINT(-106.62212966101694 35.117007033898304)

I arrived at my construction job site at around 06:45. I dropped off my tools and opened the garage doors to get ready for the day. Since I had a few moments, I stepped outside to feel the morning air, I noticed a fairly bright ""Star"" to the West of the warehouse where I stood. 
 
The ""Star"" was larger than the average star on this early morning, it had a reddish orange hue, and flickered every so slightly. I assumed that it was Mars, just peeking out over the rooftops. 
 
I downloaded the Skymaps app last week, so I open the app expecting the object to be Mars. However, nothing celestial was in that vicinity, especially not something that bright. 
 
My second logical assumption was that it was an aircraft, or perhaps a satellite; however unusual, since the light was as bright as Mars typically is.

Identification of the craft physical color was not able to be witnessed due to low visibility due to it being dark out. However, the craft was in the shape a flat octagonal prism. We new this because of the red and green lights visible at each of the eight corners of the craft.

As we were going down Salem St, the craft could still be seen but only its lights and its shaped cannot be distinguished at that point beyond the trees.

At 20:30 we (me and my wife) went for the ""smoke break"" (we're not smoking in house 'cause of kids).  Right after lighting up my cigarette, I found a light in the night sky, over Prospect Hill, and not very high.  Light was strange 'cause it doesn't looks like plane or helicopter.  I called out my wife, and we started watching that light.  After few minutes, I grabbed binocular (x30) and tried to watch object via optics, but it wasn't helpful, object still looks like a bright light.  After few minutes we noticed a second light, and little bit later the third.  These lights are slowly floated/moved in the sky. 
 
Fortunately, I do have a telescope, cheap one (truly :), this model  
 
https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32968885736.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.f2f34c4dRnKHpZ  
 
However this telescope has good aperture (76 mm).  After few tries I captured one of slowly moving objects by eyepiece (it wasn't easy 'cause of cheap telescope design, and because objects was relatively low).  But it's really hard or even impossible to estimate a real distance to objects, and real altitude. 
 
By the way, in the telescope I was able to see object a little bit close.  It looks like it has bright white-yellow light in front (like a lamp or cockpit window or I don't know...), and two small flashing lights on the sides.  These lights was mounted on airship-like dark body (but I'm unsure about shape and size).  I thought it's some kind of drone or quadcopter, but more it looks like mini-airship with mounted lights. 
 
All of these objects drifted slowly (but very slowly) or hung in the night sky; after 10 or 15 minutes one object started moving little bit faster and disappeared from sight soon (unfortunately, trees on our backyard are blocking view). Another object appeared after 2 or 3 minutes, and it came not from the ground (like a quadcopter, for example) but afar from the south. 
 
Finally, all these objects were darkened and disappeared at about 21:00-21:10. But another similar object was appeared just before I called you, at 21:50 (I went smoke, saw the object - but it was dimmer than before, and decided to call). Periodically I checked sky in that direction but haven't seen anything else. 
 
I do not know what it was:  military or private company night tests of drones/airships (flashing lights on the side looks like human made - spaceships/probes don't need small flashing lights at all), but something wasn't right. Who will allow that kind of tests in the highly populated area? Kids are playing or flash-mobbing? According to flight time and luminous intensity, it's not a regular retail quadcopters with LED flashlight attached.

On the night of October 9th 2019 at 21:00 EST, I witnessed a UFO at the Northland Public Library (300 Cumberland Drive, Pittsburgh, PA 15237).  The sky was clear and the moon was out (past full moon stage). I have frequented this library day and evening for the past 20 years and I’m familiar with the typical lights present at night. As I was walking to my car from the closed library, I noticed two lights at about 45° approaching from the Eastward direction travelling Westward.  The lights were separated a little less than 3° ; the top light was white while the bottom one was a red blinking light.  I wondered if they were stationary or moving so I got into my car and used the oil change reminder sticker on my inside windshield to measure; yes they were moving slowly and moving in together at the same speed. I got out of the car to observe and try to take a picture/video. After a minute, this slowly travelling object showed its profile to me; it was a triangular! -shaped UFO with lights (portal lights?) highlighting the whole shape of the UFO a total of about 1° width. The edges were not sharp, they were curved. After it passed, I hurried and drove to an adjacent church where I could get a better view.

Grant.  We called him ""Pappy Grant"" and he was probably in his forties at the time. 
 
On December 5, 1962, I was given a line check from Pappy, again to Rhein Main. 
 
During our two-day crew rest in Germany, we had several meals together and at one of them, Pappy related the following story. 
 
It was during a mission in over the Pacific and Pappy was navigating.  It was daylight and Pappy had the LORAN set on as well as the radar (which was always on when it was working correctly).  Suddenly the display on the LORAN scope and the display on the radar scope shrunk, leaving only a dot in the middle of each scope.  The compasses began to gyrate wildly. 
 
Pappy stuck his head into the cockpit and found the pilots gibbering incoherently and looking fearfully back as best they could from their side windows.  Pappy asked what had happened.  Finally, they calmed down enough to tell him.  One told him that a flaming red ball had just nearly hit them head-on and that he was afraid that it might return.  The second said the same thing but claimed that there were four balls instead of just one.  The ball or balls had been at the same altitude as the airplane and flying straight and level. 
 
Eventually, the radar, the LORAN set, and the compasses returned to normal. 
 
Chances are Pappy is no longer alive.  He had a master's degree in marine biology and worked on his own blueberry farm with his wife between missions.  He would eat two large steaks whenever he could and enjoyed good food perhaps more than he should have.  If you have any suggestions on how to find either John or Pappy, please let me know.  A search on line might help.  Pappy was more than just a flight examiner with a higher rank than most of us.  He was a valuable friend to us all.

story? I’m 62 and felt if I didn’t do this now, I might not ever write about it! I grew-up on a dairy farm in 
the valley of the Green Mountains in Vermont with my 8 brothers and 2 sisters. I was the youngest of 
the 3 girls still living at home. My parents and 4-5 boys were still working on the farm. 
This happened on July 12, 1972. I was 12 years old and playing with one of my older brothers 
in our hand-made sand box. We would spend hours and hours upon hours running our old, metal Tonka 
trucks and cars on the hilly tracks. I remember the day and date because I knew if I did, I’d remember it 
in the years to come. 
It was a hot, clear & sunny day around lunch time. I remember the sun being high above me in the sky. 
My mother was preparing lunch in our old, post and beam farmhouse kitchen. I could hear my mom 
talking with my 18-year-old brother thru the front door. On hot days and with no AC in Vermont, 
we always kept the door open to catch any breeze. This brother had the habit of straddling his 
chair while talking to whoever was in the kitchen. 
On this day my dad and my other brothers were finishing up their chores and taking a break from haying 
in the fields. We had a farm bell on our house, so whenever she needed them, she would ring it. 
On this strange day my brother and I were outside playing in the sand box. He had just had ear 
surgery and had a white turban-like bandage wrapped around his head. My mother had sent him out to 
get some sunshine and play with me because he had been in bed all morning. I recall he still had on his 
pajamas. I was quietly playing with my truck and talking with him when I felt a strange feeling on my 
neck and upper back. My hair was tied back in a ponytail to keep it our of the way on the farm. It was a 
strange, almost electrical vibrating feeling. Starting at my neck, traveling down my back. There was this 
weird, humming sound all around me. Almost a buzzing sound, like a swarm of bees. My dad always 
told me it was hard or nearly impossible to sneak up behind be because I’d sense someone was there. I 
still feel this feeling today if someone is behind me. 
I looked up over my right my shoulder and saw three-saucer like objects hovering over Camels Hump. 
We lived just at the foothills of the green mountain forest in Huntington, Vermont. The lower trees were 
growing taller, but you could still see the upper most, rocky top. As I watched them, I had the feeling like 
they were watching us and wondering what we were doing? They were dark grey and metallic. I can 
only describe them as two saucer plates put together. They were in a triangular pattern with one on top 
and two side-by-side just below the top one. All three looked like they were hovering and spinning 
about 500-1,000 ft above the rocky top. I was thinking the sound I heard might have been from the 
spinning. It looked like there were windows along the edges. I couldn’t look away as I was watching 
them. I didn’t realize I was pointing and screaming. I wasn’t scared, just wanted someone else to see this 
other than me. The brother who I was playing with had limited hearing because of his surgery, but told me later he had seen a flash in the sky 
when he realized I was upset and where I was pointing to. 
My brother, by the front door, heard my screaming and turned his chair to come out on the front porch. I feel when 
he moved to see what was happening, his movement made the three disks darted up and leave in a 
flash! They went up and took a sharp left and was gone? It happened so quickly! It couldn’t have been more than a few seconds when I first saw them. It felt like they were 
observing my brother and I. He said he saw something but couldn’t quite make it out except that 
something caught his eye and went behind the mountain and out of sight. I wasn’t the type of sister to make things up. 
Seeing me so upset, made my family believe I was telling the truth! I just wish I wasn’t the only one to see them clearly. 
It’s been over 50 years since this happened to me. I know what I experienced and it’s still just as clear in 
my mind as that day! I have always wondered if being hypnotized would make me re-recall this 
childhood experience again. I have spoken to my husband who is convinced I saw something and is very 
supported of my feelings. I would do this if it’s a qualified person I’d like my 
husband to be with me to validate the experience. Not sure if he would participate but he might be 
willing to. We now are retired and living in Florida. I’m just afraid that someone might suggest ideas that 
might make me forget what I saw. Is this crazy of me to question this? If I do or don’t do this, I wanted 
to validate this experience with this letter which I will keep a copy in my personal records for my family to read in 
the future. 
I have tried to research if there were any additional sightings in Vermont around this same time, but no 
luck so far. I have yet to find any searches I’ve tried on the internet. I do recall seeing in our local 
newspaper, the Burlington Free Press an article done sometime in the late 80’s early 90’s. The article 
stated someone took a black and white photo of a saucer over one of the back dirt roads in Huntington. 
I was in the college or the military at the time, so I don’t know when or who wrote it. 
I appreciate you allowing me to post my personal experience on your site!",2022-12-22T00:00:00,44.3226,-72.996,POINT(-72.996 44.3226)

I had just left my friends house on Oster Road, which was located right next to the Knollwood elementary school. I went out the back door of her house and cross the sports field of the school to cut through the playground to take a shortcut to my house on Ferndale Avenue off of Irving Park Boulevard. When I got to the middle of that sports field, for some unknown reason I just stopped walking right there in the middle of the field and looked up in the sky. Their above me were three lights, quite bright, but very high above me. They were not moving and they were positioned in a triangular shape. I immediately got the feeling for no known reason, that they could see me and we’re watching me. I stood there staring up at them and they started darting around a bit. They moved very quickly but not very far they stayed close to one another. This seemed strange because they were so high up that I knew they had to be moving very very quickly. Then one of them sort of separated itself from the other two and I got fearful that it was going to come down towards me so I just started to run. I was scared out of my mind. What I was saying did not make any sense. The funny thing was I had a difficult time running away, is if my body wanted to stay there in the middle of that field. But for some reason I was able to run even though my body didn’t seem to really want to. That just might have been fear, I don’t know.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,41.4802,-82.0997,POINT(-82.0997 41.4802)

I was five years old, getting sun as I had just recovered from chicken pox. It was around 1:00 PM on a busy corner in Santa Monica. I saw what looked like an approximately 2 foot tall by 1 foot diameter egg shaped object with rotating lights, red, blue green, purple, and yellow. I felt it was trying to get my attention. I wanted to pick it up and take it home, I was so excited to have found this brand new toy. 
As I was about to pick my new toy up, a monotone electronic sounding male voice in my head said ""Hi Meeshell, we're here for you, please don't touch our craft"" I felt very scared. I thought someone was playing a prank on me. They asked me a lot of questions and I answered with visions or pictures in my head. They told me that they could trust me and I was an important person to help them. 
As I looked closer I saw that within the egg shaped object there was a rotating middle portion which was blue and had rotating picrures of what I now know looked like grey aliens with big eyes and skinny. At the time I had no knowledge of aliens or ufos. They were very polite but I was scared nonetheless and I basically froze. 
They told me no need to be scared at all and that I was chosen. They said that they would be watching me from now on and would visit. They were reading my thoughts, and I was thinking gift as proof of loyalty. They said ""a gift"" and a drawbridge came down and a small maybe 2"" door slid open right to left The surface had previously been seamless. A small maroon egg shaped object with thick chrome colored wire wrapped around the middle and a tab bent up at one end of the wire rolled down the ramp. I picked it up no idea what it was. 
The said something like here it is. 
I started running fast to my Mom's apartment, sadly she was not there. I went to her friends house where I found her. I showed them the gift and handed it to my Mom's friend. She said ""What is this, where did you get this?"". I began to explain my encounter that had just happened. 
She started trying to open the gift. The metal wire was pliable and seemed almost liquid like mercury. She twisted opposite directions top and bottom, it opened and she pulled out a string of rice paper elephants in a line trunk to tail. She was happy for me and said it was very special and that they trusted me enough to show themselves. The gift somehow was lost eventually and I have never been able to locate it again. 
I started Montessori school shortly after this incident, and was obsessed with painting and drawing the egg shaped object but never tried to explain what it was to anyone in fear of being ridiculed.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,34.02984860397588,-118.47355293723476,POINT(-118.47355293723476 34.02984860397588)

While driving southbound on Pearl street around midnight I caught an image of what appeared to be a craft hovering over a power station on 26th street. I pulled into a gas station across the street and got out of my car to view it. It was directly across the street from the gas station above the power station and I could see it clearly. It was metallic and disc shaped. I could see the entire craft. It had no lights and made no sounds. After a few minutes the craft silently moved in my direction and then headed east directly above the power lines. It changed course to southbound Pearl Street and slowly headed down the street directly above the road. 
I jumped in my car and raced to catch up with it which was pretty easy as it was only flying at around 45 miles an hour. I followed it as it flew maybe 50 feet above my car and 50 feet out in front of it. It changed course by flying eastbound on 11th street which I followed closely. After a short distance it angled upwards and shot up into the sky at an extremely fast speed. Within 1-2 seconds it was out of sight. I reported it to the Tacoma police and the dispatcher said they had several calls and asked if I wouldnt mind talking to an officer which I complied. The officer and his partner met me at a 7-11 oarking lot on Pearl street. Unfortunately they did not take me seriously and pretty much laughed at me. Oh well it was not surprising.

A flash of light looking like very bright sunlight glint off an aircraft appeared in clear sky about 2000 feet up.  I initially thought it was an airliner (Dulles Airport nearby) but it’s path was more east to west while normal path or airliners landing at Dulles is south to north.  I was driving south and was wondering what aircraft would be flying in that direction (size of glint made me thing is was a low flying aircraft) and it just disappeared.  There was no traffic so I slow my car scanning for whatever it was but it just vanished or at least I could no longer see any light refection off its surface.   There was nothing tall enough in the vicinity I could attribute to causing this irregularly shaped bright light. 
 
This is second time I’ve seen a UFO in my life.  The first time was I was in northern Wisconsin in the 1970s when I saw a stationary cigar shaped object very high in the sky.  I could only see it that time because the sun was glinting of its metallic body.  That one was huge and its shape was very distinct.  Today’s phenomenon was very different as it was moving and had an irregular shaped, very bright light or reflection, long and narrow but not distinct and flying at a much lower altitude in the sky.

I was looking out my back door window at the stars about 7:30 tonight. 
 
The sky was clear and moonless.  I noticed a bright white light in the sky moving toward me from the south (from the direction of Eglin AFB). 
 
At first, I thought it might be a satellite, then I decided it was more likely an aircraft landing light and walked outside to get a better look.  There are no airports close enough to my location that at pilot would find it necessary to turn on a landing light, so I’m thinking that maybe the pilot forgot to turn it off after takeoff. 
 
As is typical when seeing an aircraft approaching with the landing light on, the brightness of the white light overpowers the marker lights, with the exception of the strobes, but I didn't see any strobes or beacons, just the brilliant white light. 
 
I estimated the altitude to be between 5 & 10 thousand feet, traveling 200 knots or less as it passed by a couple of miles or less west of my observation point.  My property is surrounded by trees 50 feet or higher, so, from my vantage point, my viewing angle of the craft was about 45 degrees, well above the tree tops. 
 
Unfortunately, my place is too close to I-10 and it was abnormally noisy tonight, so I was unable to hear the aircraft.  But judging from the ambient noise level, I'd guess it wasn't prop driven.  I could have heard a helicopter, and I think I could have heard props as well, but those new jet turbofan engines are really quiet, especially at the slower speed the aircraft was traveling. 
 
The first thing that struck me as odd as it grew closer and was positioned adjacent to me - the intensity of the bright white light remained the same, and did so until it went out of my sight continuing on its flight path northward. 
 
Obviously not a landing light.  At least, I've never seen an omnidirectional, steady-burning bright white light on an aircraft.  But it was close enough as it flew past that I could see four red lights well forward of the bright white light. 
 
Assuming an FAA standard aircraft navigation and anticollision light configuration, I should have been able to see a green marker light on the starboard (right) side of the aircraft, and either a white wingtip strobe, or a red or white strobe or flashing beacon on the lower fuselage, and a red or white strobe or flashing beacon on the upper fuselage or on the tip of the vertical stabilizer.  There also should have been a smaller, white tail light as well.  I should not have been able to see the solid red light, which is supposed to be displayed on the port (left) side of the aircraft. 
 
I didn’t see any beacons or strobes, red or white.  However, I saw a steady-burning red light out in front (what I assumed was the tip of the nose of the aircraft), and three steady-burning red lights behind the forward red light. 
 
In the 60+ years that I have been aware of, and fascinated by, aircraft, I've never encountered a light configuration like this on an aircraft.  And considering the non-standard light configuration, I was unable to determine the shape of the aircraft.

The bigger of the three did suddenly change and get dimmer about 7 minutes in to us keeping track of it.

    There's been something passing over Jefferson City, Mo for 3 out of the last 4 nights (raining last night, couldn't get outside). It's been between 8-9 o'clock central time every night. It looks like a star at first but if you look at it for any period of time you can see flashing changing swirling colors (red,blue,white from a distance). There's no discernible shape. It hovers and moves almost imperceptibly over the city for about an hour until it's finally out of view. 
 
   I don't have a great camera on my phone (same for hubby), but we have a telescope so we checked it out. He was able to get a good view of it in the telescope and he freaked out a little which is extremely out of character. He's skeptical of everything but this thing shook him up. He said it looked like images and colors imploding (swirling like worms) into eachother. I have 3 videos and 2 pictures from night 3, not great quality but who knows what cleaning it up might do. I didnt notice until I watched the videos this morning but when it is over a building with a large light, the light gets very very bright suddenly and stays that way for several seconds. 
 
    On the second night, a helicopter circled it and flew away. I could see the helicopter directly behind it, just for some spacial perspective. The flashing thing is completely silent, the helicopter sounded like a helicopter. It's doesn't look huge but it's visible from miles away. If it's a drone it's like nothing I've ever seen. 
 
    I noticed in the pictures to the upper left of the main (orb) object of focus are 3 round lights that first form a triangle and in the next picture are in a straight line. We were unable to see these with the naked eye. Also, if you magnify the object in the clearest photo, there appears to be 2 rectangular lights, the bottom light appears to be reflecting of what's directly below it.

Then the object stopped going downward and swirled up and maneuvered down again and then side to side.  We were driving and trees blocked our view for a few seconds but it came back into view over and over.  It did not seem like any object that I know of.  It seemed to get lower and lower going back and forth before disappearing altogether behind trees well off in the distance.  We pulled over and are completely stumped.   
 
We looked on the map and Culpeper Regional Airport is close by but no plane or helicopter or drone or anything I can imagine flies up, down, side to side and has identical in sync burning tails such as this.

I was on one of my jobs, a restaurant roof top. While up there out of my perrifial view i caught a slight flash of a sort in the direction of the soon to be setting sun. I turned to look but couldn't because what ever it is was in the direction of the sun. so i resided to take a couple of pictures in the direction of the sun, planning to look at them when it crossed my mind again. The following day i did just that and sure as a turd is brown there is something there. Now im not talking about something obscure or difficult to make out, its there, plain as day. The half dozen people ive had look at this are very quickly astounded by it because its simply not what myself or anyone else was expecting to see. I cant state that it's a ship or even something that is mobile in any respect. It's a series of circles, one inside the other from larger tom smaller. its definitely not a cloud and its material or structure is very uncertain. I guess im just hoping others will see this and ! who knows may know some thing. 
 
Have you ever read the book of Enoch? well in that book Enoch is speaking to an Angel, i think Gabriel. Any way Enoch asked this Angel what was it he was looking at that appeared like some type of Spiral something. The Angel replied, this is how we travel from place to place. This is what is in the picture resembles, to me any way. I will send you the original pic and ill send another with it pointing to the object. Zoom in to it about 25% and you will see very clearly what ive spoken here about. Its certainly interesting, different, even unsuspecting. Please let me know what you think. Thank you.

Report 2 of 2  On Saturday, October 12, 2019, my girlfriend and I were working in the yard at her house. We were working in the yard, and at 6:20 PM, I observed an object that was bright white at about 60 – 70-degrees elevation to the east of our location.  I could tell it had a shape and was not an airplane. It appeared to be hovering.  I looked through my binoculars and could see it, still very small. It appeared to be at a very high altitude.  It appeared to be a long bright loop, small and nearly closed about 2/3’s of the length and an open loop at the other end.  It slowly changed shapes to an “V” shape.  About a minute or so later, it changed to a “)” shape. A minute or so later, it changed to a straight tube or cigar shape.  I took five pictures with my cell phone. You can see the object as a small white dot in the blue sky, but no details. Enlarging the photo, you can see the shape changes. One picture, you can see the “V” shape. 
 
I called the Irving Police department to report what I was seeing and to see if anyone else was reporting it.  I was on the phone with the police department for about 5 minutes, describing what I was still looking at.  They took down my information and said they would check it out.

MULTIPLE UFO SIGHTING October 12, 2019 20:19 HOURS UNIVERSITY PLACE, WASHINGTON  This evening while taking out the trash I and my wife observed numerous objects, all shaped the same, low in the Eastern sky traveling slowly from North to South with slowly pulsating white lights and a reddish glow around the perimeter. 
 
As our house is situated on a Western downhill slope facing the Puget Sound the objects seemed to rise into view from the North and proceed in a relatively quick manner to the South. The objects made no sound that could be discerned from our location.  As the objects proceeded South, they would eventually dim and disappear. 
 
It was a quiet evening with clear skies with a high ceiling.  Where we live is near Joint Base Lewis McChord and we are very familiar with the various aircraft that fly in the area skies and the sounds associated with the aircraft used by the base.  These objects were not rotary or fixed wing aircraft using the regular flight paths as when they do there IS a discernable sound that can be heard for many miles. 
 
If the objects were a considerable distance away then their transit from North to South was pretty rapid and their disappearance was as though they went into a cloud bank however, after discussing the disappearance with my wife, we both agreed that they faded and blinked out. 
 
This event lasted for about 10-12 minutes and consisted of approximately 25, to as high as 30 objects. I took two still photographs and nearly three minutes of video of the event.  I thought that I had captured more of the event unfortunately, when I switched from camera to video, I neglected to start the recording. 
 
I am a retired Firefighter/Paramedic and very used to seeing unusual things, events or situations and accurately documenting my observations.  This is a first for my wife and me.  We hope that this was not some kind of hoax perpetrated in celebration of Halloween resulting in a colossal waste of time and resources.",2019-12-01T00:00:00,47.2013,-122.5711,POINT(-122.5711 47.2013)

My girlfriend an I went to Murray Park in Little Rock, Ar. summer of 1979. What I thought was a small boat coming from the direction of the dam just off 430 about a distance of 1/2 to 1 mile away. But the closer it got to us I noticed how close it was to the river bank wall. When I told her that it was no way that this was humanly possible to be that close to the river wall. When it became real close, the lights were not moving with the waves, but also would have been impossible, because large rocks extends at least 12-15 feet from the bank out to the river. My girlfriend was so afraid she begged for us to leave, but I told her that what I was experiencing that I would never see this again, an I haven't. I've realized recently that the alien ship was in cloaking mode except for the lights. It also had to be hovering because their wasn't any sound, an that impossible, because of the jetty. This the 1st time I've ever spoken publicly about since 1979, plus I probably would have scrutinized considering that UFO are now just been shared with the American public. My sister told she witnessed a shiny orb that came out of the river, hit the bridge, an bounced to the otherside.

I been wanting to tell about this sighting for many years. Around 1980 my Mom,Dad and brother were traveling to Texas for my dad to attend a class for work. He was driving and my mom was in the front seat. My brother was laying on the back seat he’s 4 years older than me. I was laying on the back dash looking up at the stars. Watched Star Trek back then but not a fan and didn’t know anything about sightings or things like that. While i was gazing up i seen a light like a flashlight really far away, while this was going on my dads fuzz buster was going off it kinda surprised me but before i could even finish thinking it was in my face and i froze. Next i find myself on the back seat laying down and my brother on the back dash first thought was he’s to big to be up there then i hear my mom screaming i sat up looked forward and saw the ship in front of us it was only maybe a few feet off the ground and the size of a greyhound bus orange yellow glow off the back no noise it went forward toward a blinking caution light about a 1/4 mile ahead i guess moving about 20 mph not sure it turned straight up looked kinda like a missile it went up about a few 100 feet really slow and shot to the moon in the blink of a eye. My dad was very key on time and kept saying it was 10pm not 12pm but my mom just kept screaming , I turned to my brother as he slid down and set besides me i ask him what that was and he says shut up. My mom said if we tell anyone she would deny it and call us crazy, lol. My dad passed but he always said if ever had Alzheimer’s he would never forget that.

I stopped on the shoulder and got out of my car. The craft was about 100 feet off the ground, moving very slow. It was traveling about walking speed. It was moving north in the direction of the runway at Carswell. AFB. It was about 150 to 200 feet across. The only sound was a humming sound like one might hear in a bad amplifier/speaker. 
I watched the craft as it crossed over me and Hwy 183 going in the direction of the base. The craft was very dark and the shape mostly was discerned by the fact it was blocking the stars as it passed. It was opaque as it completely blocked the light of the stars. I do not recall the color of the lights. They were solid and did not flash. Maybe about a foot or so in diameter. They were evenly spaced on the bottom side of the craft. 
As the craft passed over going to the direction of the runway, it started to fade from my view. 
 
On the west side of the AFB is a Lockheed Martin facility. My thinking was that this was some kind if prototype aircraft for the military because of the location. 
I had forgotten about it over the years until I saw some shows about the chevron crafts over Scottsdale AZ and the ones over the Hudson valley. What I saw look almost just as these. The witnesses on the show said they did not hear any sound. As stated, I did hear a low frequency humming sound. 
I call my sighting a craft because I could clearly see and hear it and because of its proximity to the Air force base and Lockheed. But since I have not seen any military plane like it since I will have to identify it as a U F O. 
It does look some what like the chevron shaped stealth plane. But I am sure the stealth plane does not fly this slow or with only a humming sound. 
 
At the time of the sighting I was an Air force reservist on my monthly training at Carswell. I do not recall if I was on my way to the hotel at the time, but I think so. I completed 7 years in the Army and then was in the Air force reserves. At the time I was in the reserve I was also working as an electrician.

Black “battleship” floating silently with some lights. 
 
I was in high school and driving home from visiting a friend. This was the normal route we took and it’s about 2 miles from our parents house. I was in the vehicle with my brother. As we drove along the edge of the reservoir where the water cascades down I noticed something massive In the sky just two or three tree heights in the air. I screamed out loud to my brother, “pull over, pull over!” I remember that we stopped the car and actually crossed the road we were heading north at the time and we cross the road to a grassy area on the east side of the road adjacent to the reservoir spillway. To this day I can remember the feeling in my chest of anxiety and anticipation and excitement that something bizarre was happening and I jumped out of the car and I can remember my brother getting a little nervous as he screamed “what the hell are you doing?“ 
 
I looked up and there it was this massive dark form against the night sky blocking out any stars so it came right over us and it seemed as though we could reach up and touch it. If you asked me what its shape was it was too close to us that I did not see it at a distance initially I sought just from below and it seem to have girders and sheep to this massive battleship sized “ship.“. It was eerie because there was no significant sound. I remember it having a low humming sound very low and not too loud but my brother remembers it as totally silent. When I say battleship it’s because I had spent time at the time in my life in Boy Scouts visiting the battleship Massachusetts in fall river. So I had some sense of the scale and this thing was gigantic. Essentially it was impossible what I was looking at it was something that couldn’t exist a battleship sized object floating quietly above our heads just seemingly above the tree line. It was traveling in the same direction we were so when we jumped out it was just coming over us from south to north and as we stood there at the edge of the reservoir it started to turn and head west in a northwesterly direction, somewhat toward the village of Brewster. I do remember it having some kind of glowing lights on it but that was not a memorable aspect they were too blurry or something. And that seems to be the primary characteristic that I remember is that the shape of the object and the lights were blurry and when you looked directly at them you couldn’t make out the particular shape even though there was angular form in this dark mass as if it was a metal structure of some kind and it did have lights. Then only five minutes after standing there the thing was already halfway across the reservoir and turned more sharply to the west and just headed in that direction sort of toward Carmel New York. 
 
My brother and I rushed home and promptly told our parents what we had witnessed and it didn’t even disrupt their television watching for the evening. I remember feeling a strange sense of dreaminess about this event when we told friends and other people and at the time we knew no one and found no one who had shared the experience. As the years of passed thanks to YouTube I have discovered the Hudson Valley UFOs. This includes a piece from unsolved mysteries television show which refers to Dennis Sant, A local public officials who I remember as a child was in my father‘s circles. Here’s a count of the ship including some of the re-creations on the show really woke me up to the realization that I had not dreamt of this experience. Because you do question after all the years whether it actually happened when there is no feedback mechanism as there is today with social media. I have since searched the Internet and YouTube extensively and watched many videos that people uploaded. They are harder to fine today but around 10 years ago there were easier to find and more plentiful on YouTube and many a persons VHS tapes were shared and I definitely felt that that was the object that we had experienced even though there was some differences in the lights and the actual shape.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,41.4098,-73.59,POINT(-73.59 41.4098)

This sighting happened at least twenty years ago but I will never forget it. It was a warm sunny day in July about four o’clock in the afternoon when I had noticed something in the sky approximately a mile away to the north, moving west about fifty degrees above ground level, (ninety degrees being straight up) moving slowly. It was about the size of a passenger plane such as a Boing 747 and was cigar shaped with what looked like having a silver skin. There was absolutely no sound, but I thought it was because of its distance from me. At first, I thought it was an airplane but then I realized I couldn’t see a rudder or wings. Still thinking it might be an airplane it started getting brighter as if the sun was reflecting from it which made me believe it was turning northerly. To my surprise, there was a vertical hole in the sky slowly opening about an airplane’s length ahead of the flying object. The closer the flying object got to the hole the larger the hole became with a brilliant light shining thru reflecting off it. It slowly passed thru the hole and once thru, the hole slowly closed behind it. From the time the hole starting opening, the object passing thru, and the hole closing, took about ten seconds. I didn’t have a reference to gage distance between it and myself so distance from me is best guess.

We were in high-school, going to the beach in the late afternoon, early evening. My friend and I were several feet behind the group. Only we noticed the craft. It was low over the water, shaped like a Comet, round at the front, tapering to a pointed tail. It looked like it was on fire, like rolling flames, not like a sparkler. It was multiple shades of orange and yellow, like fire. It moved in a serpentine motion in all directions. It would snake thru the air horizontally, nearly stop, make a right hand turn, and start snaking vertically thru the sky, then shift again snaking back the other way. It was so unnatural that we were shocked. We tried catching up to the rest of the group to tell them to look. Every time we caught up it would disappear. We'd drop back, talking about it, then it'd reappear, snaking thru the sky in multiple direction. Every time we tried to reach our friends to have them look it'd blink out of sight again. The sky was clear, it was late. The sun was low, but no clouds or other interference was blocking our view. It lasted seceral minutes, and we were just shocked. I remember it clear as day, and I've never seen another object on earth look or move the way that flying craft looked or moved. This happened before internet, so there was no one to report to. And before smart phones, so we had no camera on hand. We both saw the exact same thing and discussed it for quite a while as we watched it. We were sober, the object was fairly close, as the Puget Sound is not very wide. You can see land across the Sound, so we could tell the object was over the water, somewhere between our beach and the opposite beach. It was fairly low In the sky, and so close we could see the surface lit up like fire, but I dont believe it was actually fire. It wasnt dark yet, not even dusk, but just before sunset I think.

When I was 16 or 17, so 1994 to 1995, I was driving home late at night along the Clara Barton parkway. I was heading towards Potomac from Bethesda or NW DC, and it was nearing my curfew, so somewhere after 11 and before midnight, I believe. As I came out from the underpass (495 crosses over the parkway near here), the Model Basin came into view, as normal. What was not normal: a silvery, blimp or more accurately, burger? chipwich? shaped thing was hovering over the Basin. It appeared to be lit from within, or rather, that it had a luminescence about it. I can't recall any blinking lights, though I recall it had sort of a nubbly shape along the edges, which maybe were lights. It was very large, and terrified teenaged me. I floored it, trying to create as much space as possible between this....craft...and myself. It was super big in the rearview mirror, and it was quiet. I heard nothing, not even the usual chirping crickets or tree frogs that infest the forests along the parkway. As I sped (I drove a thunderbird, and I floored it, I was waaaaay over the speed limit), I anxiously watched it continue to hover. 
 
I know what blimps look like. I know what a lot of jets, ships, planes, fighters, etc look like. I grew up here, and you see a lot of stuff. This was nothing commercial, and wasn't a weather balloon or blimp, though it hovered similarly. It didn't resemble any space shuttle or stealth jet I've seen. It was just...totally foreign to my mind. It's feasible it was some other country's spy tech, but the silence confused me-I still can recall that detail 25 years later. 
 
The next day or so later, I was talking to a friend about it while we got coffee. A woman approached me and stated she'd spotted it as well, and called it in (not sure who she called, but she reported it) and was informed it was a weather balloon. She said it was not a weather balloon, her brother worked as a meteorologist and she knew what they looked like. To date, this is the only person I've ever encountered who saw it, and I've never seen any other references to it aside from my own posts here and there. 
 
Date is approximate as there was no internet site to log this stuff on back then. I am 100% sure it was prior to 1997, and based on the car I was driving, it would place it between Jan 10, 1994 to August 1995.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,39.0397,-77.1918,POINT(-77.1918 39.0397)

UFO happened in Salinas, slightly rural area, Uruguay 1996, just going on dark and on the spare property of mis abuelos. I was wanting to take a photo of this beautiful big bright star that caught my attention (I had grabbed my Olympus wind up camera and walked into the middle of the empty property). On the corner of my eye it would shake around. I thought 'bizarre' and looked up and it went still - but I felt like it was mocking me strangely ?. I lifted my camera to take the photo and it did it again. It would be still but shake around when I held the camera up. At first I thought 'oh, ok, the lens in the camera can't make focus at such a distance' - but it wasn't shaking through my lens, only when I actioned to focus my camera it would shake. A feeling of being mocked was starting to weigh on me. A little perplexed, I tried different settings on the camera and this happened 4-5 times until the last time I took the camera away, it continued to shake around in the high heavens above. Then it would stop and start and move around the sky - do a shake and stop. 
On the ground looking up - it was shaking around 2 cm either way but this would have been a huge magnitude in the sky. I looked over to my grandparents place wondering to go over and call for them to come see or are my eyes affected somehow, at the same time I thought I might loose this phenomenon, I'll stay ?. I would look to the ground to make sure my eyes were not playing up but my eye sight and everything was normal except this big bright star. I rubbed my eyes, I patted them. I then looked up and it zoomed left - paused, then zoomed right - then paused. A smaller, colourful one appeared zooming in (bright with reddish / pink-green outer colour (not all the way round, just to two sides) zoom up close to the one I was watching (which was paused at this time), it came from the west, paused, did a shake, paused and took off in a split second. I thought 'ok, I'm not seeing things because now there's 2, the larger one is clearly not shaking and the newer one is. I can't remember where it took off but it zoomed off fast and I didn't want to loose sighting of the bigger one by following or searching for the littler one. Then the one I had been focusing on, zoomed to the south-east a little (20cm - ground measurement), stopped approx 5-10 seconds, shook about as of to say 'bye' I think, then took off south and disappeared. I was left there looking back at where this star initially sat, and why I was there - well, I was there to take a photo of this big bright star' and was now left with nothing. Nothing sat in the place in the sky of where this big bright star was approx 10 - 20 minutes ago. I looked to the south and waited, nothing. I walked back over the fence and told no-one. I printed my photos - and there it is, a shaken star. But I hope I still have it. I can't explain anything else. I know what drove me to pick up my camera, walk over to take a picture of this big bright star, now I walked back with no big bright star in its place in the sky, and baffled to what just happened.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,,,

My female then best friend Lindsey Lowis/Lawis an I had been sat on my bedroom floor playing a board game when we both at the same time looked up from the game on the floor and while my mind was racing through “well no way a helicopter is right outside my bedroom window, no draft, no wind blowing about, what else could it be but a UFO.” 
My friend interrupted my racing mind that was trying to convince me this was not a UFO and she asked me “omg Natalie what the fuck is that?” 
Of course I knew this was out of this word, my legs shaking slightly and nervous i stood up wanting to peep out of the closed curtains, all while my friend Lindsey was stood behind me but frightened an wanting to know, but this vibrating skull/brain noise/feeling…a feeling because it wasn’t a sound and it was repetitive and we both get it. I knew she wasn’t lying because she looked up at me from the floor at the exact time I felt this vibrating feeling in head, we stood anyway an I went to put my right hand finger and thumb on the bottom left corner of my curtain to peep out but as soon as I touched the curtain or split second before it was gone and vibrating stopped, so I opened the curtains and looked outside in the dark very still night with nobody in sight but nothing there but I felt that something was right outside that window. I told my mother in the morning and actually it was school morning I’m sure but I just can’t remember as my friend an I agreed to tell nobody or we’d be laughed at by our other school friends. Lyndsey didn’t lie or be the idiot like me but she did tell one of the girls she’d been close friends with for years prior to meeting me and jokes were made about our UFO experience. 
 
I know it’s years later but I’m so sick these days I wanted to report my experience and this was not all of the strange experiences, there were approx 5 and always 1 other person present. 
 
I don’t know what would run around at 3:10am in my now deceased boyfriend’s and mother’s apartment but it did and…I can’t honestly be bothered to explain by typing my multiple strange experiences, ufo and paranormal I guess is how what I’ve seen on tv and internet would suggest. I can name all that were present with me. I did become a drug addict by age 18 so nobody’s going to believe anything I tell about this but the other people, except my father who died since and my ex boyfriend who also experienced a 2nd 3:10am paranormal type experience as I had the night before and I know for sure he did because he jumped up suddenly off his mothers sofa which we had fell asleep on watching tv, he turned the tv off and picked up the carton of milk he’d been drinking out of and rushed to put back in fridge, when I questioned why he was getting up he’d said his mother was back, meaning he thought he’d heard her walking up the stairs just as I had heard slow footstep the night before, both times it wasn’t his mum. 
 
Both son an mother tuck own lives, his was hanging himself in Durham Prison his name Scott Fisher, back in 2000/2001. His mother died just a few years ago, approx 5 years ago, Sue Fisher was her name. 
 
I haven’t had anymore of these experiences but I’ve had premonitions in dreams which came true or I’ve felt a heavy depression feeling something bad was about to happen. 
I don’t plan living with my horrific physical pain in abdomen which for 6 years the nhs still failed to diagnose or hurry up an do something about the pain. 
 
I absolutely plan to take my life because I’m too much agony mentally and physically but my health is deteriorating in this last 6 years an after witnessing the way the nhs GP’s and hospitals have treated me I do not want to wait until I’m any worse. So I’d love to tell my information which has been on my mind to report, I felt silly and didn’t even know who to contact.

On the evening of March 13, 1997 I wanted to take my wife and kids outside to try and view the Hale-Bopp comet. I had an astronomy class in college and had a telescope as a kid and have always been interested in astronomy. I think the time was about 9:30 pm. Our home was located on a small hill on a large lot with an open view of the sky. When we tried to spot the comet we all witnessed a V formation of six coppery colored objects directly above us at about the twelve o'clock position, moving east to west, cross the sky in a few seconds. These objects looked very high up in the sky since the formation looked very small. My kids were a little shook up because they knew we witnessed something very unusual.

I was out on highway road hunting and saw what I thought was a radio tower slowly blinking, until I realized it was in a holler below my vantage point on top of hill. Noticed it was slowly moving small movements side to side, so after watching it for about 5 minutes, I grabbed my spotlight out of truck. I lit it up, was some kind of aircraft about 25-30 feet wide & around 8-9 feet thick, looked to be a triangle shape with rounded tips, and on the sides of the points there where backlit red crystal like panels strobing slowly. I noticed it was extremely quiet running, was around 15 feet off the ground, and the trees & grasses beneath it seemed to be gently blowing around. After about 10-15 seconds of it spotlighted, it raised out of the holler, came at me, went over me about 20-30 feet above me, with spotlight I could make out ribbed hoses running half-spherically across the bottom of it, it was all flat black, and the thing vibrated the hell out of me as it passed over like a giant sonic toothbrush feeling. It continued to move away from me to the west, I could see approximately 60 miles, but once it was a quarter mile away it shot off out of my 60 mile view in 2-3 seconds. I used to assume it was something from Whiteman's AFB that flies aircraft thru there often & originally called them to ask if anything was flying thru there in that timeframe and they said no, but I figured they probably would've said that either way honestly.

Description Of Sighting 
I had just returned home and was standing in my driveway to look up at the stars before entering the house.  It was a very clear, moonless night and the stars were very bright.  As I was looking up at constellations in the east, a moving triangular object caught my eye.  I turned and watched as it glided swiftly across the sky in front of me.  What made it visible were neon-like strips of blue-green light that traced the outer edges of the craft.  I was amazed at how the light wrapped around the pointed nose and the two back corners.  There were also strips of this blue-green light along the side and back.  There were no other lights but these on the craft. The lights glowed dimly and had there been a full moon or bright city lights near by, I doubt that it would have been visible.  Although I could not make out the details of the objects surface, the fact that the light strips traced the outline of a long triangular object was unmistakable.  The changing perspective of the outline of light as it traversed the night sky was also consistent with a three dimensional object. The night was very quiet and no sound was detectable.  I watched until it went behind a tree that blocked it from view as it continued in a north eastern direction.  This UFO was traveling very fast in a straight line at a low altitude.

Details of Sighting; 
 
Conditions		 
Clear, moonless, quiet, no wind 
 
Size & Position 
The size of the object in the sky was almost as large as a full moon.  The altitude was much lower than that a commercial jet.  Its’ position in the sky was about a 45 degree angle from the ground.          
 
 
Speed 
Much faster that a commercial jet.  I would not say that it “shot” across the sky, but that it “glided swiftly” 
 
Direction of Travel 
It came from the south west and continued traveling in a north eastern direction. 
 
Sound 
Silent, no sound detected 
 
Location of Sighting 
Suburban, residential, at edge of town, no street lights, dark skies.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,42.5649,-89.0843,POINT(-89.0843 42.5649)

Then the 1st one shot straight up, extremely fast. It was pretty big because I could see it for a long way, and I thought they were stars after all. But when it was almost out of view, there was this huge explosion of light, which quickly faded, along with the star. My first thought was, I saw it leave our magnetosphere, which caused that light. Then I looked back down at the other 2, and the next one did the same thing. When it was gone, the last one left. Since I was busy looking up, I can’t tell you if the other 2 moved forward, and took off in the exact same place as the first one, or if they all just went up where they had stopped.

We were sky watching and something caught our eyes, a set of lights in the northern part of the sky that looked to be a single craft. The lights were various colors, mostly what I would call jewel tones, or showing the spectrum of the colors of the rainbow. Some of these colors appeared to possibly be changing or rotating through colors quickly, maybe a few dozen individual lights in the rough shape of an oval. The object hovered in one place and the sighting lasted for about 20 seconds and it shot of vertically and also quickly faded like maybe it was cloaking. As any FYI--weather was calm, sky was clear, no wind, no other objects in the sky, no sound coming from the object. Its size was indeterminate as well as distance, as it was a night sighting without anything nearby to compare it to (my guess is an object a few dozen yards across at approximately few hundred feet above the ground).

Date Aug. 21, Time 9:40 P.M. 
  
I am writing in regards to what my husband and I saw tonight. At approximately 8:35 this evening we heard and saw a turboprop aircraft, coming over the horizon from the west.There were no lights on the plane at all. The plane was coming over the top of our place at around 3000 ft. To the left of the plane fairly close, were two small objects with lights red and light yellow or white. Compared to the plane they were quit a bit smaller. I left the back of the house to go to the front to get a better look, when I got to the front yard I saw 5 strobing lights about 500 ft. apart following behind the turboprop. going north east.This time I could not see the objects only the lights, very bright and blinking or strobing red and white or yellow. Then the turbo made a left turn lights following him going west again, all disappeared in the clouds. It was very unusual, and unlike anything I have seen before. We heard the plane several times earlier in the evening but did not go out to look at it so I don't know if the lights were there at that time. There was only the sound from the turboprop aircraft, no other aircraft sounds.  We thought it might be connected with the fires here in eastern Washington.  Since you investigate sightings, I thought you might be able to tell us what you thought the lights were that accompanied that plane.

Hi Peter, 
  
I've spent the morning on the phone.  I was able to speak to the supervisor of Spokane tower and approach control.  He said that they do not cover our area which is north of Evans, WA on Hwy 25 and next to the Columbia River.  However, he was very interested in the details of this phenomena and asked to be kept informed if we were able to establish any further information.  He suggested that contacting Whidbey Island Naval Air Station would probably not produce any results.  I also assume that Seattle Center would not be willing to disclose any information.   
  
A quick bio, I'm ((age deleted)), ((number of thousands of hours deleted)) hours of flying air charter and flight instruction in the Seattle area, but that was over 20 years ago.  And another point I feel should be mentioned is we have had a lot of aircraft activity in this area because of the forest fire on Mount Leona in Ferry County and military aircraft operating in Roosevelt MOA, therefore this started out as not to unusual. 
  
I saw what looked like a Lockheed Martin EP-3E Aries II or similar, but the color was dark olive gray or charcoal brown.  It was flying from west to east about 3000' to 4000' above ground level.  It's location when we first saw it was about 48 degrees and 45 minutes north and 118 degrees and 10 minutes west.  I was moving at normal cruise speed.  It's navigation lights and strobe were off.  It was an unusual aircraft for this area. 
  
My first thought was they were doing a infrared scan of the fire area.  I did think it strange not to have the nav lights on, especially when we were in the evening transition period with a lot of air traffic in the area.  That's when my wife said there were two other lights beside it.  I moved to a better location to see it.  That's when I saw two very intense strobe lights flashing red and white.  One of them moved into close-formation on its starboard quarter, less than a 100'.  Then I noticed another strobe light appear next to the outboard one.  I did not see the third light approach, it  just appeared.  I could not hear any noise other than the sound of the turbine engines on the large aircraft.  I couldn't see any physical aircraft near or around the strobe lights.   
  
At this point I had to move to another location to continue to watch.  When I regained a view of them there were four strobe lights flying in an echelon formation from the aircrafts starboard quarter with equal spacing of about 500'.  Then again another strobe light just appeared outside the fourth one.  Then the strangest part started, they began to disappear and reappear over and over again, but in different positions. Or, there were more than five of them, but only five showing at any given time.  Finally, the large aircraft started a gradual left turn, back to the west and shortly disappeared behind the clouds north of us. We stood there thunderstruck. 
  
Peter, I've had two physical sightings in my life time.  The first was in the service and it was a subsurface craft that went directly under our ship and visible.  The second was also on the ocean during a return trip on a 44' racing sailboat 1000' miles north of Hawaii with 8 witnesses, it was larger than an aircraft carrier and about a 1000' from us.  So I'm not new to this game, but this one is a mystery for me.  I don't know what to think.  I'm just reaching out for help in understanding what my wife and I have witnessed.  I had no problem accepting the physical sightings, but this one left me with to many possibilities to consider.  Now I understand why there are so many that start doubting what they really saw because there isn't any hard evidence.  We wish to remain anonymous, however we don't mind you using this information for your research or sharing it with others. 
  
We're watching the sky more closely,

I work as a night shift security guard. As I was opening the gates to the parking lots I noticed a bright light in the east. In that general direction there is a hospital with a helicopter pad and I could hear helicopter noise so I assumed it was that. The light seemed very bright so I continued to watch it for a minute or two. At that point the helicopter at the hospital took off and broke the tree line. So I know it was not a helicopter at that point. After the noise drowned off the light continued to just sit in its position and I began walking towards the guard shack to get my phone. As I started to move I could see the one light starting to break in 4 lights. It wasn’t until it was extremely close that I realized it was a shape of a black triangle. With one light at the point, one light in the back middle, and one light left and right from the back middle light in each direction. It was roughly 2000’ off the ground (I used an altitude comparison sheet I! found online because it was very low to make absolutely 0 noise.). It was also going rough 100 mph, I state that liberally because I feel if you could drive a car in a straight line next to it you could easily keep up at 60-70 mph. It had no blinking marker lights to indicate wings or a tail. It did had a singular strobing light underneath that was only visible when it was directly over head. In 2000 there was a black triangle sighting in this town that was chased by three different police departments towards saint Louis, MO before they lost sight of it. There is also an Air Force base within 30 miles from where I worked so I thought maybe it was a plane heading there which might explain the no markers, but I don’t think it would explain the lack of sound and very slow speeds.. it was coming from the east moving west, slightly north away from the Air Force base as it left my sight of view",2019-12-01T00:00:00,38.7631,-89.6789,POINT(-89.6789 38.7631)

I happened to look up at a fast moving cone shaped object descending rapidly out of a low hanging cloud. The sky was blocked out by these low clouds. The sun either had already set or was blocked out by these grey low hanging clouds. There was approximately 35% ambient light remaining at the moment of the sighting. The clouds were at 1500 ft and broken. Some clouds were higher some lower but blocking out the evening sky. This object as I said dropped rapidly to approximately 500 ft elevation. It hovered there for 3 seconds then, It flew rapidly to the right, stopped after traveling about 30 degrees across a 180 degree field of view. After traveling quickly across that distance it stopped abruptly, held position for 3 seconds and reversed direction. It flew back in the direction from which it came as it gained altitude. It made several quick upward maneuvers as it traveled never changing shape as an aircraft would as it would turn to, or away from you as it m! aneuvered. It then stopped abruptly again. Hovered for an instant then it moved back to the right, as it very rapidly descended downward out of my field of view. It never reappeared in 5 minutes as I continued to scan the evening sky. I happened to be walking my dog and my dog alerted me to it, which began my sighting. My dog was frightened by the sight and she immediately turned around and headed back to the house we had come from 30 seconds before. It made a very faint humming sound as it maneuvered. It was cone shaped and seemed as though a bright whitish green light was suspended below the cone. It had what appeared to be a bright white light at the apex of the cone. These lights never changed their relative position as it sped around the sky. I am a 66 year old man. I have excellent uncorrected vision.

As I was driving southbound on Queen Elizabeth HWY 2, roughly 2/3 kms north of the Leduc overpass for the airport, to meet a friend for a pick up at the Edmonton International Airport (YEG) I noticed flashing lights above the road ahead of me. They were red and blue if I'm not mistaken but the fog made it difficult to see very far. As I continued I noticed a distinct triangular shape to the flying object and as it got closer I noticed it was quite close to the ground for a plane, less than 50 feet from the ground. The craft passed directly over me and thanks to my large panoramic sunroof I was able to see the bottom of the object as it passed overhead. Unfortunately the time of night made making out any details other than its overall triangle shape almost impossible. I did notice one thing though, how extremely quiet it was. Not a single noise was made as it passed (I turned down all my radio as it was approaching). I've worked at this airport in the past as! well as others in the area and if a plane or any engine would to pass by at this distance you would absolutely hear it. I hope others have seen this, I'm just trying to make sense of it.

I was driving to work. It was on a road with lots of farm land. The sky was a weird color, like yellowish because the sun was just rising. Something caught my eye. It was moving through the sky along the tree line going the opposite direction of me. I slowed down thinking it was a smudge or something on my window. It was circular. It looked like it was almost invisible but it wasn’t. There was like a shadow or just slightly darker area. It was moving so precise and steady. I kept staring until I couldn’t see it anymore as it headed the opposite way. Then, not far behind it came another one, going the same way.

There were two large, round, orange lights hovering within the same vicinity. It was as if there was an invisible line between them when the object/craft(?) began to move in a non-linear trajectory. It seemed to slowly disappear in front of my eyes and I assumed that it was being enveloped by clouds in the night sky. My husband also witnessed the lights. I'm not a good judge of distance from the ground though it appeared large and close for its size. My description leads me to believe it was a large craft though I only saw two separate lights--orange and round in color. It was amazing and I couldn't find anyone else who saw it other than me and my husband.

Back in 2004. I was around 14 at the time. 
 
The disk like craft was up in the Sky about 100 yards away from my house. As I looked at it, it approached the house to take a turn over the gardens attaching our house to the one behind it. 
 
It paused at the window where I was looking at it for a good 20 or so seconds. During this time I had a clear view of the craft. 
 
It was a disk that had edging on a slight upwardly linear gradient. On the top and bottom were tower like structures made from something black that looked like hard silicone but a metal… slightly porous maybe? (imagine a three legged based Eiffel Tower that was been twisted but the gaps in between are not linear and seem random - difficult to explain this form as it’s not something we see in our typical design patterns) and the central disc was emanating very bright light but it did not light up the surroundings of the craft. The light was blocked from exiting the craft. 
 
The tower like structures were stable and not moving but the central disc was rotating. It was initially rotating right but as it came to take the left turn it stopped rotating as it hovered outside my house before then rotating left as it shot off from 0 to whatever it was. 
 
Call it sixth sense or just an remnant of our evolution but when it first stopped I had the ‘inner feeling’ as though whatever was inside did not see me but this changed and suddenly the feeling of being noticed was experienced. At this point the craft took off.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,,,

This was in approximately early summer of 2005, so it was almost 17 1/2 years ago, but I remember it fairly clearly. I believe it was early summer because I remember a friend and I were in my above-ground pool late at night. No one else was home, as the rest of the family had taken a cruise that week. I stayed behind because I was working two jobs and couldn't take off. The neighborhood was very dark, very still and very quiet - so much so that we were nearly whispering when we talked because talking in a normal voice seemed like we were yelling. We were just relaxing and enjoying the evening (it was a clear evening - no clouds), when suddenly I became aware of some type of aircraft that was (very) slowly approaching us. I remember being stunned because 1. It was flying extremely low - barely above treetop level (75 ft. pine trees). 2. It was SILENT. Zero noise. That's what freaked me out more than anything else. 3. It seemed like a very dark gray and had some lights underneath on the edges, but none of the lights were on. My friend and I just froze and I remember feeling like I was trying very hard to hold my breath. I remember feeling frightened because I didn't know what was capable of doing that or if it it saw us. I felt that it did. As it came closer, we both (without discussing it with each other first) sunk down lower into the water and closed our eyes as it passed. When I opened my eyes, it had passed directly over us (was still on the same flight path) and we watched in silence as it passed over three or more houses. We looked at each other for a moment - trying to wordlessly verify that we'd both seen the same thing - and when we glanced back, it was gone. I remember that we were suddenly freezing in the water (when it had seemed warm before. I'm not saying this was a result of the object but perhaps because the experience gave us chills. We got out of the pool and were both shaking almost uncontrollably for an hour after that.) 2005 was really before drones were mainstream (at least, as far as I knew... and certainly before I knew what they were) but at the time I thought surely it was something military related. I remember specifically thinking that it was flying below airspace radar detection levels - something I had either read about or seen on the news in the wake of 9/11 (which is the only way I would have even known that there was such thing). I remember it being large but it certainly wasn't house sized or football field sized. It really freaked us out for a few days - I just had an overall uneasy feeling. It may actually be the first time that I experienced anxiety now that I think about it. My friend and I never talked about it again. I have thought about it fleetingly over the years randomly - thinking wow, that was so strange, but again, never thought much of it. However, I recently watched the latest Unsolved Mysteries episode about UFOs/UAPs and it made me rethink that experience. I googled in an attempt to find other reports of sightings around that time to hopefully verify my recollection. I found this site. I didn't find any in my area, but to my shock, I found many, many, many similar reports. After reading all of the reports on this site, in articles, watching shows, and reading the 2021 pentagon report (with a new report to be released sometime this week), all spanning multiple decades, I'm now a believer. I feel it is important to mention that, while I do enjoy watching Harry Potter and other fantastical shows and movies with my children, I do not believe in real life magic, ghosts, luck, etc. and I am an atheist. And, even after seeing what I saw all those years ago, I did not once think ET beings/vehicles existed until now. There are too many similarities in stories from people who never met each other and are not obviously mentally ill to call it coincidences or delusions. Especially considering that there is no way technology existed in the 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s, 80s or possibly even 90s that would account for the things people have seen. Also, I've seen several mentions about these types of crafts being near interstates. The pool was approximately 421 feet from an interstate. I'm including a google maps screenshot with an annotation I added to show the pool (the yellow highlighted dot) and the direction of flight. I'm also including some photos/renderings I found on this site, the history channel site, and google images. The object seemed almost like a combination of those images to the best of my recollection. 
 
It may be that the event is completely explainable. But, since I've seen so many similar accounts, I thought it was worth reporting.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,30.8319,-88.0944,POINT(-88.0944 30.8319)

This was a few years ago when I was a teenager, so my memory is pretty weak about everything time-related. But my memory of the event is crystal because it has been the only UFO I've seen in my life. 
 
I was riding in the back of my dad's truck. We were coming home from a family visit up in Chesterfield, South Carolina, and I was napping as we went home on the Ruby Road, which runs for miles and miles through Darlington and Chesterfield counties. When we got toward the plant, which was close to home, I opened my eyes and just watched the clouds go along because it was a beautiful summer day (that's why I think it was in July or August). Something silver up in the air caught my attention as we were driving along. When I focused on it, I could clearly see it was much closer to me than the clouds I had been looking at (like superimposed, or like you would see a helicopter in the air and you could judge distance). 
 
The craft itself was bell-shaped. It was very far away, and the truck was moving, but there was a definite curve to the top of it and a flat bit on the bottom. It was very bright, very shiny, and it was just hanging there in the air. I saw it for five or six minutes, and I kept my eyes on it as the truck moved and my position changed, so I'm sure it was just hovering. Dad kept driving and I eventually lost sight of it. 
 
The most interesting thing is that we were close to the Robinson Nuclear Plant. I've never seen anything like it before or since. I just felt like I had to tell someone about this after seeing your interview on the new Missing 411 movie.

I was only around 8 or 9 years old at the time. The only witness I still have contact with doesn't remember the event. It was recess just after lunch at the swing sets when my friend kept talking about how he could see a UFO and it took me a while to see what he was pointing at. Once my eyes locked in on what I was seeing, it was clear that it was not a plane or a cloud. I was looking directly West and around 80 degrees upwards from the ground. It was a metallic cigar-shaped object. On the left of it, there was a light obscuring it's end where it may have come to a point. The craft was high in the cloudless sky and appeared relatively large and very high in altitude accounting for atmospheric scattering of light (like how a distant object appears slightly blue). It was slowly moving straight up, and as it moved, the light that was emanating from it's left end was pulsating and growing brighter while also dimming and becoming invisible at times. This gave me a chance to really observe the light. The light pulsated in a very distinct pattern that would rotate. It almost seemed to be a physical object while also being very bright. The pattern resembled a typical starlight pattern viewed through an optical device like a telescope. 
As the object continued to ascend, it got so high up that all that was visible was the ""light"". Eventually, the light was no longer visible. It appeared to have left the atmosphere, entirely. 
My friend said he saw an orb shoot out and was doing weird maneuvers in the sky while my eyes had drifted away. At this point, I was still processing what I just saw, so I didn't see the orb he was talking about but played along as if I did. 
The cigar shaped object never went in a different direction - just up. It was very enticing, and I had a very real urge to follow it somehow. 
Physically, I and my surroundings experienced no effects that I am aware of. I think everyone forgot about it shortly afterwards. 
 
I should note: nothing in this story was exaggerated, fabricated, or left out regarding my entire observation of this object. As far as I know, I am the only witness; however, there may be more witnesses in the area that I just never talked to about. 
 
I am not 100% certain about the date and time, but I had to have been in third or fourth grade at the time (2006-2008). It was warm, not quite hot, cloudless, and before or around noon.

Hello UFO Center, hope all is well. Let me start by introducing myself. My name is ***** and I live in Texas with my wife and my son. I am 30 years old, and have had an assortment of occupations in my short time here so far. I started working as a bricklayers helper out of highschool for about three years. From there I managed a Furniture Store warehouse,then worked in technical support for AOL from '99 to '01, back to brick work, then a 5 year stint with the Pepsi Bottling Group, and now am a paramedic for East Texas Medical Center at the age of 30. I'm telling you all this to give you at least some idea of who I am. I met my wife at the age of 17 and have been happily married ever since. I love my family and happily work hard for them. 
 
 FIRST EXPERIENCE  I am writing you because I dont know where else to go. I have been ""visited"" by an unrecognizable object on three seperate occasions. Now your probably thinking, ""Big deal, people have been seeing UFO's since mans beginning."" Thats kinda my perspective on the topic. However, four nights ago, a thought came to me that made me wonder why I didnt think it sooner. The thought was, ""of all the stories and reports and accounts of ""alien encounters"", I have never heard of or read about any report that was even close to mine. I am almost hesitant to continue, for I am not sure if you will even read this, but here goes.  I have had countless abnormal experiences in the twilight hours,  but these three are the ones that demand my attention.  Three visitations, the first one around May 22 or 23 of 2007, I was by myself.  We were living in a house in ********* which is a very rural area just outside *********, Tx.  We had moved there in June of '06.  I had quit my job at Pepsi ! in December after my fathers death in November of '06,  and was preparing to start EMT-Basic school in January.  I worked at a telephone operating center while I went to school.  I worked mainly afternoons through nights,  during the slower hours.  This proved advantageous,  as I was able to study and do work in between calls.  I was still working as an operator,  just finishing EMT school. That spring I had discovered information on the mayans and other topics such as Edward Leedskalnins book Magnetic Current,  which sparked interest and curiosity like I had never known.  This was also the time when I started almost mindlessly drawing all these geometrical shapes at work.  I would get in this zone and just drawing all kinds of equilateral triangles and evenly section them off and make all these beautiful designs.  I had bought a compass and a protractor and would make a grid of evenly spaced dots and begin to make perfect circles with my compass,  making this flower fo lif! e pattern.  I occasionly  to this day will sit down and make f! lower of life.  Now, first encounter was around my dads birthday,  which was May 22 - I remember that much about the time frame.  I'm not absolutely sure of the exact date, but I would say it is accurate within a week either way. I didnt record the date of the first event. It just never occured to me to do so. I saw it at about 11:30 at night and my wife was asleep. I had stepped out on my back porch for a smoke,  which I did every night,  as I am some what of a night owl.  Standing on my back porch I had a greatly limited view of the sky,  as there were two giant oak trees,  one on each side of my view,  along with my garage/shed on my left and the house on my right.  I would say I could see about 1 percent of the sky from that spot.  As I stepped out and lit my smoke,  I noticed a very bright, large star directly in front me (It was due west), about twice as big as any star I had ever seen,  and much brighter than any star I had seen.  Initially I didn't give it a second glance,  ! which is odd because I was out there every night and never recalled seeing it before.  Well,  about halfway down my smoke I look up at the sky and noticed the large bright light again.  This time it caught my attention.  As I looked at the star,  I remember asking myself,  with my head slightly cocked and intense curiosity, ""What is that?""   The next thing I remember thinking was that it looked like it was moving.  I stilled my head and squinted my eyes to maintain focus,  and sure enough it was moving very, very slowly and subtly to the right,  barely even noticable.  At this point I was hooked.  I became ignorant of everything around me and about me,  and anything else I might have been thinking on.   As I stared at this single bright light,  it began to seem like it was now getting lower in the sky,  then I noticed it was getting slightly larger and brighter.  I was frozen.  All my focus, energy, and intention was completely engulfed by this light.  In what seemed like s! econds,  the light's altitude in relation to the horizon was c! ut in ha lf.  The light became much larger and brighter and very clear,  with no glare, halo, or haze surrounding it.  It was at this point that I realized this light was descending and approaching me at a very fast rate.  At this point I had stepped out in the yard and had a much better scope of the sky,  including directly above me and back over the house a good way towards the east.  Once I realized this light was descending towards me,  it only took what seemed seconds for this flying craft to be directly over me at a very, very low altitude,  probably around 400-700 feet.  Now,  this craft had absolutely no sound signature,  except for a very low humming/vibratory effect that I felt more than heard.  Right before the ship was directly above me,  at some point I became oblivious of the large bright light that i guess was on the front of the ship,  and my full attention was shifted to the light display on the underbelly of the ship.  I'm really not quite sure how to explain this p! art,  for the under lights acted in a way that seemed more organic than artificial.  On approach,  I saw a mixture of red and yellow lights.  The lights reminded me of little seperated l.e.d.'s.  At this point I could make out a vague outline of the craft,  although I cant recall the exact shape for the lights had me somewhat ""hypnotized"", feeling very disoriented and confused as I watched the bewildering light show.  When I first saw the lights they seemed to be in a square pattern,  consisting of 15-20 individual red and yellow l.e.d.'s.  Now this is where it is hard to relate the account.  I cant think of any one word to accurately describe the action of the lights. While staring at the lights,  instantly,  with fluidity,  the lights were now in a circle shape,  with me never seeing any lights go out or new lights come on.  I never looked away,  as my exposure to the underlights was only about 10 -15 seconds long it seems.  The lights rolled or shifted,  or whatever you ! want to call it,  into two or three different patterns before ! it compl eted its low fly-over.  As it passed over the house,  it started its ascent and as quick as it approached it was gone,  first a farely bright light,  and gradually dissappearing within a minute or so.  I cannot describe the intensity of emotion that came upon me,  I was exhilerated.  I have never felt that quality of excitement up to that point.  I ran inside as fast as I could to try to wake my wife up,  shaking her and telling her I had just seen a UFO!!  She wouldnt wake up. I went back outside for a little bit before retiring.  I told her about it the next day.  She knew I had seen something,  but I think she thought I had just seen some kind of military aircraft or something else explainable.  The very next night,  as my wife and I sat inside our house,  she watching t.v. and me on the internet (probably researching the mayans,  as I had just gained knowledge of them and thus much interest),  I felt/heard the low humming vibration.  I looked at my wife wide-eyed and rem! ember exclaiming ""THATS IT!!""  I ran outside just in time to see the ship ascending towards the east,  just as it did the previous night.  This is where I think my wife became convinced that I saw something,  for I described the event to her earlier that day,  describing the humming sensation it emitted,  and now she felt it too,  only she didnt make it outside in time to see it.  I was a bit bummed because I knew that without seeing it for herself,  she would never fully believe or appreciate the experience as I had.  The very next night,  for the third night in a row I heard the ship,  running out too late to see it.  Thats the first time. 
 
  SECOND EXPERIENCE  The second time was on Febuary 13 of 2008.   At this time we were living about 5 miles north,  with my wife's parents and her brother.  We could no longer afford the house in Union Grove due to the tremendous paycut I accepted by leaving Pepsi.   We moved in about July of '07.  After that first encounter,  I spent alot of time outside at night,  peering into the night sky,  looking for something else spectacular to happen.  Then one night it did,  and when I was least expecting it.  Right around 11:00 p.m., my wife and I had stepped out on the back porch of her parents house,  a medium sized commercially built log cabin with a covered wrap-around porch.  The back porch faced due west.  We had a 35-40 foot tree line for our horizon about 75 yards behind the house.  There was forest on both sides of the house,  so again our view was fairly limited.  We stepped out and approached the northwest corner of the house to smoke.  Thats also the corner of the house our ! bedroom was in.  As we turned and stopped, facing the backyard(west),   I remember noticing this incredibly bright looking star,  and upon recollection,  I remember thinking that it must be some planet,  but for some odd reason it didn't catch my interest initially,  which was abnormal for that season of my life.  The light was hovering,  as still as a star, for about the first five minutes we were out there,  just over the tree line.  Then my wife broke the silence,  inquiring seemingly to herself,  but out loud, ""What is that?"".   I responded, ""What?"",  not really sure what she was talking about.  She pointed at the bright light and said, ""That,  what is that?"".   As we stared at the light,  we almost immediately thought we noticed slight, slight movement.  At this point,  something clicked,  and I knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that this was the same thing I witnessed the previous May.  I remember putting my left arm on her right shoulder,  as I was to her right,  and j! umping up I shouted, ""THATS IT, THATS IT!!"".   I quickly ran i! nside to our bedroom to retrieve our camcorder,  which used mini cassette tapes.  I ran back outside stopping a few feet short of my wife,  who was now a couple of yards off the parch in the grass.  I looked up, and to my amazement I saw two very clear, large, bright lights descending out of the sky,  coming directly at us.  It was as though a giant car was floating in the sky,  as the lights were next to each other horizontally,  like headlights.  I tried to hold the camera in the direction I thought was correct,  for I was unable to pick up the lights on the fold out screen.  At this point I was repeatedly telling my wife,  ""THATS IT,  THATS IT,  WATCH FOR THE LIGHTS,  WATCH FOR THE LIGHTS!!"".  Less than a minute later the ship was passing directly over us,  slightly higher than the first time I seen it.  As the headlights were ""out of view"",   I say that because I never remember seeing the headligts go out,  its just like one second your looking at the white lights,  and the next! second all you see is the red and yellow lights underneath the object.  Just like the first time the red and yellow l ""l.e.d.'s"" became apparent,  and just like the first time they did their little ""dance"",  shifting from one obscure pattern to the next.  The humming sensation wasn't quite as noticable as it was the first time,  I assume because of its slight ly elevated altitude,  and I am quite sure that there were more red and yellow l.e.d.'s when I had seen it the first time.  It seems like this second time there were only around 10-12 lights displayed.  I was fascinated.  I'm thinking ""what in the world is going on!!??""  The lights stayed visible for approximately 10-15 seconds,  just like the first time,  then it reascended and was gone in the east.  I couldn't hardly beleive it,  yet there it was.  My wife received first hand experience,  and it was like a huge weight was lifted,  because now I had somebody else who had seen it,  and could attest to the validity of ! my experience.  I recorded the date and the time that it happe! ned.  I' ll never forget it.  I checked the camcorder,  but for some reason nothing was recorded.  Im guessing the settings weren't ready for nighttime viewing. I was outside the next few nights,  but it didn't appear again.  I told many people close to me about the experience,  both family and friends,  including our three closest friends,  Brian whom I worked with at Pepsi and his wife Michelle,  and a bricklayer friend of mine name Joe.  However,  I could tell that nobody really thought we had seen anything ""unusual"",  with the exception of Michelle I think.  That would all change. 
 
  THIRD EXPERIENCE  The third encounter occurred on November 19 of 2008.  We had moved out of my in-laws house in April of '08.  I left my job as an EMT at the end of Feburary '08 in exchange for a job for a fellow named Al Ozment,  who owns USFoam,  a company contracted to put out coal mine fires in North America.  Mr. Ozment,  who previously was a firefighter in Oklahoma,  patented the process to effeciently extinguish fires in underground mines,  as well as recieving a patent for the formula of the foam that they used,  which they also manafactured.  I was offered a handsome salary,  much more than I made on the ambulance,  and a position putting out fires.  As it turned out,  he had only hired me to help finish a firetruck that he was going to enter into a show in Indiana,  firing me two months after hiring me,  after all the business with the show truck was done.  I returned to my EMT job,  getting re-employed that June with the same company that I had left that Febuary.  The s! ilver lining to that experience was that during that short time at USFoam,  one night while shopping at a local dollar store,  I ran into an old bricklayer friend,  Joe,   whom I had worked with in masonry out of high school.  We fell out of touch around '01,  and I had always wonderd where he was,  driving by where I knew he had last lived,  but with never any luck.  I feel that if I hadn't left the ambulance position,  my path would have turned out differently and I probably would have never ran into Joe.  We moved into a duplex in a town called *********, Tx,  about 8 miles south of my wifes parents house,  and only about 3 miles south of the house that we had lived in during the first experience.  Two duplexes down lived some friends fo ours,  Brian and his wife Michelle,  whom we had known since I had worked with him at Pepsi.  A few times I had poured my case out vohemently to Brian, Michelle, and Joe,  who all politely listened to me,  but afterwards would always try to convince me it was just some kind of manmade aircraft.  So now the stage is set.  There we all were,  all at my duplex on the evening of November 19.  It was around 10:30 or 11:00,  and I was heading to the backdoor of our place to join my wife Shelly,  and our friends Brian,  Michelle,  and Joe,  who were all already outside on the back porch.  My back door faces south and our neighbor we shared the duplex with is on the east side us,   As I stepped outside onto our small 8' by 8' concrete pad,  I took one step out,  and with my very next motio! n, for some reason,  i stretched my neck up and peered back up over the roof,  towards the front side of the house,  which faced north.  As I was doing this,  the other four were continuing to talk about whatever it was they were discussing.   Turning my gaze to the northern sky I immediately noticed a solid,  nonblinking light above the northwestern horizon of my rooftop,  which was the size and brightness of an average star in the sky,  that was moving east at a fairly moderate pace.  I was floored.  I shouted for evreyone to look.  Now we were all focused on this light moving steadily across the sky.  As the non-blinking light steadily moved east,  we noticed a couple of planes wiht their anti-collision lights blinking that appeated to be passing close to this object.  Then we see a much smaller steady red light that briefly appeared near the light.  As the light was now to our right(northeast) and getting close to being out of view,  it did something totally unexpected.! Instantly,  in the blink of an eye,  this solid white light ! was redu ced to about half the size and instead of white it was now a bright blue,  dissappearing completely in less than 2 seconds.  I was stunned.  It seemed that whatever it was moved across the sky at the same rate and distance,  and instantly moved very far away ver, very quickly.  As we all stood there,  staring at where the light used to be,  all of us simultaneously telling what we saw,  without even thinking about it,  I whipped my around to the left,  facing west,  while everybody else continued to look north/northeast.  Due west,  just above the power lines that ran down the next street over to the west of us,  was this huge cluster of individual yellowish orange lights,  kind of like this:  OOO OOOOO OOOOOOO OOOOO OOO    The pattern was more of a round shape,  with less of a linear arrangement than above,  more like a balanced matrix of lights, and I'm not sure exactly how many individual lights comprised the cluster,  but it was close to the number in the diagram.  I am standing in awe,   taken by this sight.  I remember,  almost in a dazed state,  asking everyone to look over here.  It was like someone had quickly erected some kind of stadium light over there.  My mind was wrestling to decipher what I was seeing.  Out of excitement I remember repeatedly saying,  ""Ooh,  look over here,  look over here!!!""  We all stared frozen in awe.  Joe broke the silence by saying, ""Aw,  thats some kind of tower.""  I spent many nights outside and never had I seen the hovering cluster of lights,  so I knew that it wasn't any kind of tower.  I told Joe this.  The next thing I ! remember was noticing that the cluster looked like it was rising in the sky.  When I frist saw it it was very low in the sky,  just above the western horizon of the neighbors house,  just above the power lines.  The lights rose for about 20 or 30 seconds.  As it rose it never dimmed or brightened,  nor did it get any bigger or smaller,  which I guess means that it was going straight up,  slightly towards us as it rose.  After it reached its apex,  it starting gradually getting bigger,  as though it was descending towards us.   It isnt realy clear when or how,  but at some point after we noticed it descending,  I dont remember seeing the cluster lights,  but instead two fixed, white,  non-blinking lights on what initialy appeared to be wing tips,  and one single red light,  non-blinking as well,  in the middle of the two white lights,  all appearing to be on the underside of some type of craft coming right at us.  Somehow I knew at this point what it was.  I remember falling! to my knees,  staring into the sky the whole time,  yelling, ! ""Thats I t,  Thats It,  Watch for the lights, Watch the lights,  Watch the lights!!!"".  As it approached us at an altitude very close to the altitude it was the first time I had seen it,  the fixed lights seemed to become unnoticable,  and the single red light in the center underneath was now joined with many other single little red and yellow lights,  just like the other encounters.  Just like the other visitations the lights did their little shifting ""dance"",  doing patterns different than the ones it did the first two times.  Also there wasn't near as many lights this time,  maybe 10 all together.  The same humming/vibratory effect was present.  As we all watched this pass over our heads,  no one said a word,  except me maybe,  I do know I was very excited and remember repeatedly yelling, ""Watch the lights!!"".  It passed directly overhead,  slowly started its ascent and within a minute it was gone,  completely out of sight.  Now they believed.  No three night flyby this time eithe! r.  It was just on the 19th.  I remember a couple of nights later,  for some reason I started thinking about the dates of the encounters,  and began wondering if maybe there was a pattern.  What I discovered was that each time I saw the ""ship"",  it was on a half moon.  I measured the days and found out that it is exactly nine moon cycles between each half-moon occurence.  Then,  just recently,  I started thinking on the fact that I had never heard of a UFO case like mine and began researching UFO reports and cases.  I decided that I could use a fresh perspective,   and I would much like to hear what you think.

The first time I witnessed it with a friend of mine the whole sky turned lime green but the second time i witnessed the ufo/uap with two friends i witnesses this thing shapeshifting; first it was an orange glowing ball then it changed into what i describe as ""a 6ft metallic pinball"", but what really got me interested is that this thing shapeshifted into this ""sparkler"" that was also dripping this orange glowing goo in the woods of henderson(more than lilely the goo is still out there if you wanna collect samples)let me tell you this thing can manuever just like a fly, can stop in mid air stationery & it can dart off at extreme rates of speed;the fastest thing ive ever seen. 
 
What REALLY got me interested & frightened at the same time is that it turned lime green, went from a sphere to a circle in shape, expanded in size then shrunk, what i believe was a moment it teleported(facts)then there was this loud sonic boom that scared us so bad we left from the woods running back in the house. 
 
I actually have pictures and videos of this ufo/uap that i can share to the world(thank god for tripods)i tried dragging the photo onto that check box but idk if that that checkbox is working properly but dont worry i can email you the photos and videos, trust me, you will be amazed by what i will show you ladies and gents.

My wife and myself, in 2012, were driving from Santa Fe, NM to Oklahoma city, on a road trip around the US. 
When we saw the UFO, it was close to mid night. 
 
It was on Road 412 in OK, I remember because my old Garmin GPS was on, as we do not live in that area and we relied on it to make it to our destinations. 
 
This is a road with almost no traffic, it is a VERY LONG, STRAIGHT, one lane each-way road. (see google maps) 
 
I was driving on cruise control at about 110MPH. I was young and reckless, but the weather was nice, and I had really good visibility. 
 
All of the sudden, a bright, white ball, showed up out of no where, it came from behind us, in a bit of a diagonal direction, meaning, it came from the direction of my right side back, and stayed in front of me, slightly to my left at about 12 feet from the ground and about 15 feet from us. 
 
It kept a steady distance from our car, so from our reference point, it seemed to remain in a steady position, meaning, it was traveling at around 110MP, it didn't wobble, did not go up or down, it didn't make a sound, it just stayed fixated in the same position and distance from my car. 
 
10 seconds later, it just accelerated from the position it was in, with reference to my car moving at 110MP, to the horizon. That distance was covered in 1 second. It didn't go up, to the sky, it went straight, keeping more or less the same height. 
 
This road has no lights, no main cities nearby, it was not a star we saw high up in the sky, it was very close to us, it was not the reflection of my headlights in the electrical cables that follows the road, this road has no elevation, no turns, no traffic, just a boring straight long road. 
 
I am an engineer, I look for explanations for the things I see, this was not an hallucination, we were not under the influence, it truly is what we saw. 
 
Nothing happened to our car, our electrical systems, our vision, everything kept a normal condition, other than us being shaken up.

It took about 10 minutes to get to us. It was going very slow and staying at tree top height. Which was very low as we are in a valley. It made no sound at all. It was dead silent. It was black with a red light on the middle of the under carriage and each of the angles had a gold light. The white light that we saw was coming from inner window of the front of the craft. I would have to say it was as large as a small home. It went past us going maybe 10mph as we watched in amazement. After we watched it go north and disappear we went in the house to get changed.

I looked out the window and there were 2 maybe 3 great big what looked like military choppers flying low with red lights on them.They flew towards where the craft was seen when we got home and then minutes later they flew in the same direction the craft had flew in before we couldn't see it anymore.

I was around 16 years old, and only a day before, I watched, for the first time, a video on how tornado is formed; That night there were many cars on the road. We could see this thing in the east, but not everyone cared. when I saw a tornados end going down the same way as it did in the videos, I wanted to see will it become a tornado; but above it was a spacecraft that created it; it vanished while I was looking away and tornado stopped going down. Before it formed there were orange flashes on the horizon. I though it was military secret weapons to manipulate weather. Going to the present, a few days ago I watched some videos from the quest tv and started thinking about how their stories connect to mine. I realized that those ""advanced"" things could kill anyone they wanted, for no rational reason. stories from people who report those things pull me away from talking or reporting them, yet since ppl are killed I dont feel safe eighter way. In my opinion when forces so unstoppable are used for terror instead for development and good, that makes them initially less advance then they seem to be in their own eyes. This was my struggle on should I report this or not; since I suffered in physical and mental ability since then, I want to let someone know, even if it doesnt make a change or sense. The thing that aligns with conspiracy theories is next: when I was a child I had a dream where I am chased around my room by some beast. Ever since then, or maybe even from baby days, I was getting afraid of staying alone. I think that fear actually tells the truth, not a lie, of a real threat. After sighting, I told a few friends and family members about what could be seen on that night. In years to come, I was loosing my happiness and ability to work as needed. Had experiences of sleep paralysis. My stomach was hurting without a way to cure it and similar health issues with almost fainting and throwing up. Started taking medications for anxiety and depression a few years ago. After 3 years I stopped taking them and that was extremely hard period after. I feel better without them, trying to learn programming and somehow overcome health barriers to become capable of taking care of myself on my own, without medication drugs that just made the health state worse. I dont know if mental health can indeed be manipulated; yet since there is no man who talked about these things who seem normally happy, I realize that my story had to go this way as well. I wonder if things will ever get better for myself. I am also certain that it cant be just any fear that creates this instability in people. This has to be an inducted fear, and not our own fault, as it seems. Plus it perfectly fits in an idea of why to make ppl crazy when they clearly saw, in eyes of those who hid it, a hidden reality. I am not a threat in any way, yet I suffer for simply seeing things that made themselves seeable. This is not a fault of us, so why are we punished for it, when in reality, its their own fault for being so undeveloped, and they continue to experiment with lives like they are nothing? Its simply not ok when ppl who get involved, because of their best characteristics, get killed. Its a horror and fear for everyone. And it simply is a nonintelligent way of ruling the world in that regard. They could simply talk to people and explain them individually, without destroying their lives, what can we expect and we can then make different deals that fits out capabilities. On this way, we are all simply unaware and scared. And I dont really know if me reporting here is fine, or is it again a mistake; I dont want to go through what I experienced mentally again; and even in sleep I dont know if I will get abducted or whatever, and I simply have to sleep to stay healthy. This is a disaster, yet there is always some bright side that could save the world. Maybe things wont be deadly as they seem they will be to me. Hell, only thing people who get themselves in these situations can hope for is to believe in good in them and a god, somewhere, who will, over time, create a living heaven for the whole history of universe. Maybe we get there by doing good things, despite evil we can face on our way, that will always, at least by aging, end us. That would be my humble thoughts on this subject.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,,,

As I lay floating on my back in the swimming pool I was studying the stars on a clear summer night when my eyes came to rest on a small cluster of what looked like stars but it was not a normal constellation - it was three stars arranged equidistant in a triangle. The most stunning aspect of the experience for me was the way the formation seemed to sense that I had noticed it because it kind of “flinched” the moment I spotted it as if it didnt want to be seen and began evasive maneuvers. It started to dart away but suddenly stopped as if trying to make up its mind and then it streaked across the sky at metaphysical speeds, came to an impossible abrupt halt and then - poof - apparently ascended into oblivion.

.June 14, 2015 had some chase me down the highway in Beeville, Texas. Was doing 70mph, at first it was just one flying in front of me directly over the road, it then circled around my truck and came up from behind me, I looked out to the side of my truck and realized the whole area was lit up, I was to scared to look up to see how close it was above me. I hit the gas and spead up, it then circled back in front of me, it crossed the road and suddenly blinked super fast 7 or 8 times, when it finished it disappeared for four seconds and then a new one appeared and copied the same super fast blinking 7-8 times, now there was two of em. This whole time they were maybe 50 ft in the air and 75 - 100 ft in front of me, mind u this whole time I was doing 70mph, it's like they were able to lock speed with me. They were the same size, randomly moving around, off and on blinking. After a few miles they slowly started going up higher and higher directly above the road. I was finally able to pass em, and eventually lost sight of em. Then a few miles down the road I saw a group of three of em flying parallel with the road heading south and I was heading north. These were about 100 yards from the road on the lefthand side of road. These were different sizes a LG, med, sm and they flew in a tight triangle formation and it wasn't a perfect triangle the bottom left was the smallest and was flying a little closer to the top one which was the largest. It reminded me of whales and dolphins how you see the babies swim just underneath the parents. They flew 15 - 20 ft above the trees and they were shining down a beam of light as they flew, I could see the tree tops light up as they flew. When they got directly parallel with me, I looked away, because I got scared that they were going to pick up on my sense that I was nearby. I looked forward waited a few seconds then did a quick turnaround and looked just to make sure that they had kept going, and hadn't started following me. They were about the size of a soccer ball, cantaloupe and a softball. I eventually made it to a gas station all I wanted to do was tell people what I just saw but I knew I better just keep my mouth shut. I looked up sightings for that city and realized there have been many similar sightings over the years. I kinda developed ptsd from it for about a year, would have dreams about it and can't help but constantly looking at the sky while driving at nighttime. Forgot to mention that all the lights were white and super bright.

Just a note - I'm an engineer with a graduate degree and a I'm generally a rational person. I was not under the influence of anything when I observed this and was in good health. I viewed this object from a second-floor bedroom window to ground level on a dark night. No reflective surfaces were nearby. Object was 2-1/2 to 3 feet long, perhaps 6-7"" wide on average, mostly oblong, transparent white with amorphous ""fuzzy"" borders. Its motion was generally slow and steady and it was moving along shrubbery/plants with occasional pauses. I wondered if my eyes were not focusing and if it was some kind of whitish rabbit or mink, which would have been highly unusual but not out of the question, but then its shape altered, kind of how a bubble alters as it's being blown from a wand, if that makes sense; it's size did not change appreciably. After moving along the garden, it came toward the house along a perpendicular line (for the most part.) Once it came close enough I could no longer see it; I went downstairs to ground level and did not see it. I returned upstairs and it was no longer in view. It is hard to describe how it moved, but when I went snorkeling recently, I realized the movement of fish along a coral reef was strikingly similar. So I don't know if it was actually on the ground per se, or perhaps just above it.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,42.35140689655173,-71.18813103448277,POINT(-71.18813103448277 42.35140689655173)

My children, their father and I we're on our way back from watching a movie at the movie theater. As we were driving we were close to home my significant other at the time and I saw a very bright big light in the sky almost like a big flashlight we were stunned because we couldn't identify that we never saw anything like that before. I rushed home and I parked in our parking spot and we got out of the car all four of us and it was approaching our apartment it wasn't very high up in the sky and it was very large maybe like the size of two football fields and it was diamond shaped we could see it but they were parts of the ship that seem to really blend in with the night sky it was almost transparent aside from the shape of The Craft.

Hello my I am ((male's name deleted)) at the time of my Unidentified flying ball of fire experience and sighting. I was driving south on HC 20 towards pipestem wv, as I started to cross the bridge I noticed the ball of fire as it could only be described.The object was traveling at high speed of deceant at what I could judge was a 40degree angle based off the line of travel compared to the top of the bridge . Now as I reached the other side with disbelief I turned my vehicle around and proceeded slower back over the bridge as the fireball crossed over the bridge in plain view and continued its course down into the bluestone scenic river below. My view of the object was lost due my vehicle sitting below eye level of the bridge so I am unsure if it made contact with the water below or if it hit the ground. With the most accurate I could be about it’s size was the ball of fire was the size of a small house which I know could be caused by a multitude of things. With that said I would suggest it’s center mass to be around the size of small single prop plane or a little larger. As I approached the northern side of the bridge and attempted to find a place to park it was out of sight by that time. I have not been able to find any notice of a plane going down in that area nor anyone else reporting the siting of a ball of fire. As I know this is years later that I am making this report and my family thought I was crazy then but As my family and I were renting a cabin in the Blustone national park for that week visiting my daughter. I figured that if it had been a plane or such there would have been some notification. I will stand by this statement and plan to search the area in the near future when I travel back to WV in the coming months. The date range was around August 9-13 of 2016. I had even attempted to take a photo with my phone at that time but can only find one picture for the entire month of August 2016 left in my google photos. If anyone has any explanation that doesn’t involve a conspiracy theory or government cover up. I would be interested to know on a scientific and educational level.

My partner at the time and I were walking home with our dog after taking her out to go to the bathroom before heading to bed. We lived in an apartment by the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks in the Ballard neighborhood of Seattle, WA. We were facing SW, towards the direction of the ocean. 
 
At first I thought I was seeing a biplane with no lights on flying way too close to the city - but it made no sound. I opened my mouth and pointed at it to my partner and as I did so it began moving in a way that didn’t make sense if it were a biplane. I remember asking what the heck is this at that point. 
 
Silent and mirror-like. The color of the craft was so stealth it was as if it reflected the night sky around it. You could almost say like it moved as if it was not even in the same night sky. It was just so quiet for how big it was and as much as it was definitely there it was also very difficult to really “see” it. However I also think that could be an effect from the perceptual dissonance of seeing such a huge flying craft so close with an utter lack of sound. I’d never seen anything like this. Complete mindf***. 
 
My partner quickly saw it as well. We had very much an “oh s***” moment as it came from what looked like over the ocean, maybe 500ft in the air, crossed half a mile NE and dropped down to a stop about 100ft above us. 
 
Me, my partner and even my dog were staring at this thing for possibly 10-15 seconds as it stopped and slowly rotated like a football being spun on the ground. Then just as soon as we were able to register what was happening and that something phenomenally out of the ordinary was above us, it began to raise in altitude and as fast as it started - it was over. Couldn’t have taken more than 3 seconds to completely disappear into the night sky.

(Disclaimer: This is an old story from when I was in high school, I've since moved away. I still remember it like it was yesterday. I have several videos but will not put them online as part of them takes place at my house) My friends and I were driving around and saw a strange aircraft, a cross shape with rounded ends like two popsicle sticks. There was a white light on each end. It flew straight, stopped in midair and hovered, then flew another direction without turning. We tried following it, but we noticed a lot of helicopters in the sky including one that seemed to always be going the same way we were, so we grew anxious and gave up the chase. We witnessed the aircraft again (or a different one) near the intersection of Bartlett & 59, and this time it was doing flips in the air. About the size of a 747 or something but definitely not a plane. It would rotate upside down (if it even had a sense of 'upside down'), fly around, stop on a dime, go a different direction, go straight up or straight down while parallel to the ground, a lot of different things. It flew off to the north and we gave up following. Then we saw another one on Struckman Blvd near Sunrise Park. It was the most active, doing barrel rolls and all the actions described above. It was also lower in the sky, so we got a sense of how big it was. As we headed home, suddenly the sky was full of big passenger planes (Boeings and such) flying extremely low with bright lights on, so bright they functioned as spotlights on the ground and too low to realistically land anywhere except the small local airport (though that was in a different direction). Obviously they didn't crash, but it seemed like they were looking for something.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,41.9778,-88.2018,POINT(-88.2018 41.9778)

I had just had a horrible breakup a month or 2 before and I was thinking about really dark thoughts. I was walking on my front lawn, towards my front door and a bright and expanding light got my attention. ( I usually like to find constellations on a clear night before going home). In person I could see a pentagon shape of a white lights focused in at a single point expanding slowly, and I believe rotating, after 6-8 seconds it seemed to either explode or disperse. The moment I noticed I got my iPhone out to record within 2 seconds of noticing. ( I like to document my life). I have not edited or done anything to the video except take 2 screenshots. I have no idea what it could be, one thing I’ll note, I usually watch the , SpaceX boosters come back at night and day, Artemis and shuttle launches, and I can confirm I have not Seen ANYTHING. Like. This. Before. I went from being heartbroken that night, to wondering wtf just happened. If I were to guess the altitude I was looking at, it was very high in the atmosphere, similar to when a booster or other large object falls through atmosphere, but I have never, ever seen such a perfect pentagon expand from a single white bright point, evenly expand like this. This truly shook me and I am barely getting around to tell people now. Let me know if this is really something. It went from white, to Light blue. Odd thing is, when a booster falls through the atmosphere at night, usually at that altitude you see light from the setting sun above the lower atmosphere reflecting light off the trail, but I’ve never seen light at that altitude glow past midnight. We’re usually fully in the earths shadow by 2am. The video has geolocation, time and shot on iPhoneXR. Went from 5 lights, to 3, then 2. Then just slowly faded.

preface: No, this is not my idea of a joke to waste your time. I have held onto this experience for years and have told only few close friends out of fear of being judged. I am probably going to immediately discredit myself by saying this but at the time I had taken about 100 ug of LSD. I feel like this is very important for me to mention even though I am probably about to be discredited because I have a very big sense that I was ""picked out"" that night for ""research"" because of doing it. This was not my first time doing it, and even though the experience horrified me it was not my last because I wanted to see if my brain would ever ""go there"" again and It hasn't. I am very clearly able to separate the hallucinations from whatever happened to me that night. 
 
The night started at my dad's house. I had just started tripping on the acid I had eaten roughly a half hour before and my girlfriend thought it would be best to move me to her friend's house because I was laughing too hard and we didn't want my dad to question my state of mind. I agree and she drives me to her friend's house on the other side of my neighborhood. Once we both arrive the night played out as normal as it could have for the situation for about two hours. I had brought a dab pen with me and remember all of us sharing that watching to wong foo (or lsd's version of it where time stops and its just a single drag queen frowning in a car staring at you soullessly for an hour(don't do drugs, kids.)) about halfway (at least I think) through the movie I don't know how or why but I go from laying on the bed, to standing in the middle of the staircase with nobody around me. I had been entirely teleported in the blink of an eye. I'm there for maybe five seconds before i'm shot into a different room downstairs in the house, and then eventually I am sucked up out the roof through the corner of the house (It felt like i was turned into gas and sucked through a tube, but I kept flipping and sticking to the sides of the wall like one of those sticky knick-knack guys you throw on the wall.) 
 
From here I am entirely enveloped by a soupy gold/yellow light that would switch from the gold/yellow glow to a more analogue orange glow. I can hear a part of myself say ""this is deeply wrong"" and I am then shot the image of a face right in front of mine. It was almost humanoid but it was entirely translucent and actually lacked a ""face."" no eyes, maybe some small indents to indicate a nose or mouth but it as very subtle if it had anything. The face would have horrified me if I saw it in a movie or dream but for whatever reason I stayed entirely calm. As a hospital frequenter (I break bones a lot) I could tell this was some sort of doctors office. the room was small like a patient first room and I could see about two or three more of these entities shuffling around in the background assisting. I was on an operating table of sorts made entirely out of the same light I was enveloped in before. Somehow from here I am able to see the back of my own head and skull outside my body only It doesn't look like my head at all. The only way I could tell it belonged to me is because I saw them start digging a scalpel into the back of the skull and immediately felt the most release of pressure I have felt in my entire life. This was indescribably the most satisfying feeling I have felt in my whole Life and I don't even know what they did. It felt like they had sent a charge of white light through my brain only to remove more white light, like they had purified something. In this state I am sent back into the enveloping light and hear myself once again say ""this is deeply wrong."" I am immediately transported back to my body, sitting in perfect full lotus pose with my right foot sitting up top. As soon as I look at my right foot I notice a giant white blister on my toe that wasn't there immediately before the experience. I noticed the blister had the same white almost translucent color that the entity from the operating room had. it disappeared within a few days but I couldn't help but worry that contact with the being or the craft I was inside of had exposed me to some kind of radiation/etc. Again, I understand that this will probably be discredited because of my aforementioned illicit drug use but again I strongly feel that I was chosen to be studied/met with at all because of the open state that it allowed me to be in at that time, or to make the story easily discredited (like that one Simpsons episode where Homer got abducted but the aliens drenched him in whiskey so nobody would believe him.) (Again I swear on my mother's life this isn't joke or a made up story.)

It was so large that it appeared to be bigger than the size of the distant moon appears to be to the naked eye. It lasted for under 10 seconds and it was so close that I was sure that I would hear it crash nearby, but it did not make a sound as it soon disappeared on the horizon.

HI, 
 
I was looking up online about identifying UFOS. No video or picture I seen was simular to my encounter. I came across your website where it said to email if I had a sighting. 
 
My sighting happened just as the sun was going down. I came home from work, walked in my front door to where I rolled myself a cigarette inside. I walked out again into the front of my house to smoke my cigarette. 
 
As I walked out from my front door I seen something in the distance in the sky moving towards my direction. No sound, nothing. 
 
As I watched, my body completly froze and what I seen in the distance spotted me. From afar, in a split second it shot right up over my house. 
 
I was unable to move and as I looked up watching. My whole life started to flash before me. The only way i can describe this is how its said to happen where life flashes with a person before they die. 
 
That's exactly what happened at first. The lights were so bright I was unsure of exactly what I was seeing and the size of what I was seeing at that point. 
 
I seen 3 red lights in a regtangular shape. What I seen next looked the only way I can describe, like a chanel on a tv that isn't fully tuned in. Where the image on screen distortes and splits in two till its properly tuned in. It did exactly that. 
 
Looking at the 3 trangular lights I started to see the whole shape of the craft, it was a big circular shape with 3 red lights in a triangle shape on it. 
 
At this point I started to get a really bad feeling in my stomach and in my gut. I never felt something so completely wrong. 
 
A small circle in the middle of the craft started to turn and open. The absoulte fear that came over me ill never forget. 
 
Ive always been a very intutive person. And anyone that knows me would always say that . However, this was a feeling I never ever felt or experienced before. 
 
I knew if I stayed there it was gonna take me. Finally my body had movement and I ran inside in a panic. I panicked so much I was not able to even pick up or hold my phone. 
 
Something in me then said what the hell am I doing?. This is unheard of and a once in a lifetime opportunity. I put myself together as quick and best I could and ran back out. It was still in the same place right above my house. I looked up, I felt it look down on me. Then it shot up into the sky and dissapeared. 
 
I had to leave that house after, as it didnt end there. 
 
With 2 people staying with me after my experience, because I was too afraid to stay there alone. We all witnessed the same terrifying things nights after. 
 
I had a sky light in my room. What we all thought was the moon that we had seen through my sky light way over half an hour of us chatting. 
 
When walking outside on that exact spot I was in before for a cigarette. We each said upon walking out how small the moon was that night. 
 
The ""moon"" that we all seen in that same spot through my skylight for about an hour at this stage. Suddeny was not the moon anymore. 
 
It shot down from up in the sky right over my house. I started uncontrollably crying bearly able to breath. I didnt even see my friends reactions. 
 
A fighter jet came in that moment and chased it away. I ran so fast leaving my two friends behind running to my parents house 10 minutes away. I never went back to that house after that. 
 
I feel very lucky to have seen what I did. The fear was outweighed by how special I felt with my first encounter. 
 
To see my life flash before me. To be unsure and in a situation unknown. I can honestly say in that very moment and even now to think back on, my heart felt and feels full. 
 
There is only one reason why, and here is where the intuitiveness comes out in me. 
What is real in this world for sure?. I'm not sure anyone can answer that.... 
 
What I can say though, 
 
Is what i seen was 
 
REAL. 
 
What I felt was 
 
REAL. 
 
I seen a part of the world we live in that's real, and I didn't have to die to feel it.

I was a passenger on Southwest flight Nashville to Boston, about 45 min to 1 hour into the flight. I spotted off of the left/north side of the plane, an all-black, flat line shape with some depth, which was keeping the same speed as the plane. It was about 1/4 mile out, at the same altitude which was around 30k feet or above. I watched for 2 to 3 minutes trying to make out the form, then the shape started moving closer to the plane maintaining the same height. Similar to 2 cars on a highway, one moving from the fast lane to the middle, while you're in the right lane. When it got closer, it then changed angles, ducking down lower and when it did, the sun reflected off of the body like a metallic reflection. That was the only moment I saw it go from a black line to another shape which was maybe triangular? I told my husband when he picked me up at the airport and he thought maybe a stealth bomber. But that would have been much bigger, I doubt they would fly it towards a passenger jet, and I don't think it would have a metallic shine to it. This was also a flat line with no visible cockpit area. The weather was clear and dry.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,,,

My family was testing out our new telescope and had attached my iPhone to the lens to see how videos through this relatively inexpensive telescope would turn out.

As it was focusing on the moon, which we only noticed upon review of the video, an object appears to materialize out of thin air and travel quickly across the screen. Since my focal point was the moon, the object had to be near the moon and moving very fast and likely very large, for me to be able to pick it up.

It was almost 2 years ago now but at the time didn't know how to or who to report a sighting. I wrote down at the time what I had witnessed and now will share it with you. 
 
15 minutes ago, 2300 hrs, Sat 11th Jan, 2020. Dingwall, Scottish Highlands. Went out to my apartment balcony for a cigarette, was looking towards the West when I saw a bright orange light emerge from the back of the hill about 5 miles away. I at first thought that it was an aeroplane but the light wasn't flashing just a faint pulsing glow. I was waiting to hear the sound of an engine but there wasn't any sound at all. It was difficult to guess what altitude it was flying at, but guessing I would say 2-3 thousand feet. It took about 4-5 minute to pass my view point. I have seen Chinese lanterns before and this was definitely not one, it was travelling at a steady controlled speed. I then came inside to view it from my East facing window for about another 10 to 15 seconds until it just disappeared as if to go behind a cloud, its a clear night and not a cloud in the sky. Really freaked me out. Was very sceptical until now.

I looked and the puppy turned his head towards a craft hovering about 1 foot off the ground. The craft was silent it was about the size of 3 SUV's. The craft was turning quietly.

So I was having trouble sleeping this night at about 1:22am I decide I would go smoke a bowl to help me sleep. Well when I walked out of my room I noticed the whole house was being filled with red and blue light that was breathing. 
My first reaction was it was ambulance or police lights as I have family from my age to very elderly all along my street and across the street. When I walked out he door I couldn’t believe my eyes it was an absolutely flawless flying saucer as a metalworker I couldn’t see 1 flaw. 
My first reaction was to get a picture or video but my camera on my iPhone would focus and it looks like a shitty picture of police light. When I tried to get a video my phone keep bouncing back to picture and after 5 attempts I got a message saying video feature not accessible. Which I have never seen before or since on a iPhone. At this point I put away my phone and it was 1:48am 
So I forgot to Mention this in my mufon report but I sent a thought at the craft asking to take me on board and show me if there’s a hollow earth or land beyond the ice wall of Antarctica. The thought that came back still give me chills. Immediately I got a thought not in my voice saying “I we did that you would have to agree to be are slave for he rest of your life. You would never be able to see your family and friends. I replied with a loud Fuck That! And was half way in the front door when I looked back at it and thought when is the next time I’ll see one of these and decided to watch it untell it left.

Two events were recorded photographically at the exact same location 53 weeks apart. The location was at the coastline in North Myrtle Beach South Carolina. Event one occurred at sunrise on July 12, 2020 at 6:26AM. Event two occurred July 19, 2021 at 6:37PM. I only report and talk about sightings that are based on photographic evidence as I did in MUFON report 103691 (09-26-2019 Toledo, Ohio) and MUFON report 114460 (02-05-2021 Ft Myers, Florida). 
Unfortunately, the MUFON system tends to ‘bury’ photos and reports, making retrieval and dissemination to the public difficult. I have been reluctant to file these photographed events on MUFON for that reason. 
Event one was photographed at sunrise at the beach on 07-12-2020 at 6:26AM. The photos are from a collection of about 50 taken with a Nikon 300mm lens, over a period of about 11 from 6:21 to 6:32AM. Photo 1 is a wide-angle view that includes a man walking in the left side of the frame. Photo 2 is a zoomed-in view about one minute prior (6:26AM). Photo 3 is a closer zoom with three circled features as follows. Left Feature: ‘Water-Tower’ shape. Center Feature: a castle-like merlon projection. Right Feature: Platform with Square Peg. 
Event two was recorded 53 weeks later in 2021 using a high quality android phone and the same features were photographed again on the exact same section of beach. Photo 4 is a cropped version of the original taken on July 19, 2021 at 6:37PM. This late-in-the-day photo has a slightly different view of the same features in the same left to right positions. Photo 5 has highlights circled as follows. Left: ‘Water-Tower’ shrouded by dense white mini-cloud. Center: Merlon projections obvious. Right: Tall saucer sitting on Square Peg platform. 
I challenge anyone to say that these photos events do not represent the same craft. This ship has the appearance of being not man-made and also probably not of the grey alien variety that usually use very flat vehicles designed for their 40 inch stature.

I saw a black boomerang shaped object in front of the moon and there 2 small lights diagonally above the left side of the Moon. I became very distracted by it That I had to pull over. I kept looking at it  trying to figure out what it was. I knew it wasn’t a cloud and I knew it was not an airplane because it was not moving it was very still. Then i saw the 2 small lights as I described before...I was unsure but amazed by it.  I never saw anything like this before.  I didn’t know what to make of it. I grabbed my phone and took a picture of it....I really didn’t say anything to anyone about it. But then I came across this website.

On Wednesday October 16 between 7:25 and 7:35 PM I saw I very large triangle with a light on each corner fly from north to south in a straight line, pointy end first. It took about 2 seconds to fly across the sky and out of view. I would guess at least the size of a football field though it’s hard to say what altitude it was at. About 2 full moons across, or if holding a ruler at arms length about 3-4 inches on the ruler. The lights on the corners were very large, facing down, and very dim, yellowish, not as bright as the stars or planes over head. No flashing lights or lights in the middle, just the 3. Completely silent. I was standing in Logan Square (Chicago) facing west. If it wasn’t going so fast I would have tried to take a picture or video but then again it was so dim so it might not have been captured. This was just after sunset and there  was lots of ambient light. I would say it was definitely faster than the jets during the air and water show. Any! one facing west and looking up would have seen it, it may have been dim, but it was brazen, unmistakable and unmissable for the two seconds it took to fly from one end of the sky to the other. There were aircraft in the vicinity but none chasing the object, which I imagine to be impossible. I would also like to include that it was flying virtually parallel to the streets that run north-south, so not traveling southwest or southeast etc.

This was the second night in a row we witnessed these lights. My fiance filed one on the 15th. We only noticed the one ufo then, but had speculated there may have been more than one. Last night we witnessed at least 3. The light was once again very subtly moving and changing colors (I saw purple/green/red at various times). There was an instance where a plane or jet flew over the object and it then began to rapidly change colors. I also noticed the light rotate to a point where I was able to make out a bit of a shape. I saw a triangle, though my perception honestly could have been off. I took some video with my phone. This was a particularly starry night. I didn't think I'd be able to catch anything since normally my iPhone can't pick-up the stars at night as the camera is only so good. It did catch this light though and the movements I was catching was truly extraordinary. It was blinking/flashing and moving at speeds/in directions I've never seen any norma! l aircraft moved. It almost looked like something you would see in a video game/computer. Almost like a mouse cursor moving. The main light we saw was to the southwest. At some point while I was recording this light, my fiance alerted me to another UFO just to the Southeast at a bit of a higher elevation. This light was a bit more stationary, but had many similarities to the light I was recording. After we had gone back inside, about an hour later at 2:30 AM, my fiance called me into the kitchen to show me another light to the northeast of our house. I took some more video from my office window at the back of the house and once again I captured it doing some more movements. Unsure what these are but at least one of them gave us the distinct impression that it was investigating or searching for something.

This is the 2nd time I saw something similar to what I saw in the summer of 2008 in Indiana. 
 
My fiance went outside to put trash to the curb, came back inside to tell me to check this blue light out in the northwest sky. He knew it wasn't a planet, wasn't a bright star, and didn't look like any sort of plane. A plane actually went by it, I'm sure miles apart in the sky, but from our perspective it was a couple feet. It doesn't seem like something the military would make because of the way it moved. 
 
It was a bright star similar to how bright Venus and Mars is, but it changed to red and blue, which at first we thought was an airplane, but it kept spinning in circles as if it was searching for something, when it was moving to the right it would become elliptical- like it was stretching, moved really slow, hovered and spun around and around. 
 
It would slowly move back and forth, up and down. It even made a zig-zag pattern in the shape of an S, my mom and daughter came out, while it was harder for our daughter to detect the movement, my mother saw it. And was shock no F-16 were up there investigating it. It even got dimmer at one point. And my fiance just checked it again now (01:17) and its further to the right of where it was when we first saw it. We were going to use our daughter's telescope- but couldn't find all the pieces we needed to get a closer look.

I was on my way to work on october 17th, I was driving on interstate 81 going south. I had just passed the exit/interchange between I-81 & I-80.I came around the curve after the interchange to a long straight away around mile maker 140, where there is a straight away heading towards a mountain. I then saw a extremely bright glowing white light hovering in front of the mountain about halfway up the mountain. This bright object was neither on the mountain nor was it shining a light at the mountain, it was just hovering in front of the mountain about halfway between the peak and base. There are no homes in the area and consists of only trees. I continued to stare at the object because I had never seen a light in that part of the mountain, and honestly have never seen a light as bright as this object. The object then proceeded to shoot to the left at an incredible speed and then immediately shot into the air faster than any object I have ever seen. It was gone w! ithin a fraction of a second. I have looked for that light every day since the event hoping to see it again, so i would be able to rationalize that it was some sort of manmade object, to no avail.

On October 17 around 8:30-9:00 at night, me and four other friends of mine took a walk. While we were walking we decided to go on a bridge (can be found on google maps at E 67 Street Raytown Mo) that was nestled next to a brewery and was right above a fairly busy road. 
 
It was pretty normal until one of my friends thought that they saw something in the sky. They described it as a disc like object that had lights on it that flashed from red to green very quickly. This was not an airplane as it was not in the flight pattern and the red light on a plane is always on and never flashes. We all figured that they were just scaring themselves and ignored it. 
 
Then I saw a flashing light in the sky that was also going from red to green but it was to far up to see any outline, before I even said anything about it my second friend of the other 4 saw it with me. We both, almost  simultaneously, said “What is that!?” Of course everyone’s instinct was to look up at it. Including me and my friend that saw it, 4/5 of us saw the light. 
 
The light continued to flicker until it eventually disappeared. I was thoroughly freaked out and was ready to leave but everyone else was fine so we stayed. Then the same friend that saw it with me and another one (now all of us except one had seen the lights) saw it twice. The first time they saw it it was for a split second and they were the only ones but the second time everyone saw it besides me. 
 
At this point we all had seen it and now we wanted to get to the bottom of it. We all went through the possibilities. It couldn’t have been a drone because they are loud and can’t legally go over 500 feet here. It couldn’t have been a plane because it wasn’t in any flight pattern and had the incorrect lighting. It could’ve been military equipment because there is a military base around here (this cannot be found on google maps) but it is scary nonetheless. 
 
I then started stalking the sky in search for something else and we all saw it two more times where the same thing happened. I then noticed here that the lights have a “V” shape so them with duller reds flashing with no green with the main light. Then upon more stalking me and one other friend saw two “stars” in a perfect line to each other moving along the sky slowly until we decided to look away and lose track of it. 
 
All five of us saw the same thing over and over again on that bridge and it was not anything I can really rationalize with.

We were heading down south main st towards Ansonia CT with my fiance driving our toyota camry and me in the front passenger seat. It was dark out at this time and the leaves had fallen off the trees at this time of the year. This road is a one lane road going in each direction woth houses to our left and the naugatuck river to our right with woods on the other side of the river with some houses mixed in. We were almost at our destination when a huge shadow started crossing the road in front of us. When I looked up to see some faint lights and a craft the size of a football field was silently gliding over the road above the house to the left heading over the street going over the river to our right. It was so low it felt like I could throw a rock and hit it being just over the top of the tree line. As soon as I spotted it I point up towards it and said to my girl do you see this spaceship to my amazement with her jaw dropped she answered oh my god yes it is huge and so fucking low as she slowed down the car so we could watch this thing slowly creep across the road and over the river and in the direction of Oxford ct. It lasted no more then 10-15 seconds I didnt even try to find my phone because I was in such awe of what we were seeing I was afraid to miss any part of the experience. It was so low we were able to see details the craft. It had no wings and wasn't a triangle or saucer shape. It had a few lights underneath it but they were really faint and dim. If it was farther up you probably wouldnt see the lights. Its shape is hard to describe. The best I could descibe it because it was so big was sorta tear drop shaped and since it was night and we were seeing it from underneath we could tell it was metallic but wasn't smooth it had alot right angles and detail. If I was to pick a craft it mostly looked like from TV is it resembled the Millennium Falcon from Star Wars but 10 times bigger. From other sitings ive seen online this was significantly bigger and different shaped. The only one I seen online that was bigger was the one in Phoenix but that was a triangle sorta boomerang shape. This was solid from end to end. I couldn't believe something that was this big could be so silent or be able to fly at all. When we rolled the windows down to see if we could hear it there wasnt a sound at all not even a stong breeze sound just nothing. like a balloon floating weightlessly over us. Ive seen strange things in the sky before but I never imagined I would be this close to something this amazing.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,41.3885,-73.0791,POINT(-73.0791 41.3885)

Will be sending more information. 
Started happening about a year ago or so. Never used to believe in this sort of thing, so am completely ignorant to this situation. I believe myself to be a good person and humanitarian, and known to be immaculately clean, intelligent, perceptive, and know the law well. I am frightened because I feel the phenomenon has to relate with the Diabolical. Photos come up missing, everything I have come up missing, and only some things come back (ie. my phone, pictures of my family or , and anything else - not the diabolical playing tricks on me) so I hold the objects on my person because I don't want the UAPs to get hurt and I don't know what to do. I am frantic. I need an expert on these things, which is why I need somebody to talk to. 
My computer and phone have been hacked into, I've seen car from Washington and New York outside my home when I try any form of research on the situation. 
My son says that they are trying to make contact, almost like it's desperate, but a lot of information has been erased unwillingly from my phone. 
Stray cats in the area have been affected terribly, eyes glowing and some of them dead or still living. Had a dog in the home, wasn't affected, but could detect areas of the home and began acting strangely. There are more than I could imagine, demons/evil spirits and UAPs. When I was asked by you if I was being watched, I told you that I did. I thought that this was some kind of whacky thing, because most people who feel this are, but those who say they do should be heard. Because they aren't being heard they feel like they can't say anything. I am a good listener, ye or no questions and like to be asked (and vise versa) to be able to get to the bottom of things. Only recently, both good and bad, have I felt like I'm being followed. 
I don't want to look any further into this, I just want to pass the message. I'd rather die than let anyone get a hold of this information that aren't good people. 
We waited too long, and we're scared, frightened, any other form to describe this fear. I have only a couple of priests to back me up, an engineer, etc.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,41.4319,-91.0485,POINT(-91.0485 41.4319)

Me and my parents traveled to SANYA,HAINAN ISLAND, South China Sea for a month-long vacation from April to May in 2021, the night we saw this object is at 7pm. (4.29), it was a quiet evening, only the faint calls of tropical insects, me and my parents were taking a walk at the street we lived in, my mom was walking in front of us, my dad was walking backwards, I was heading ahead, me and my dad were in a face-to-face position, chatting a little. After took a peaceful walk for a while, suddenly he said ""Why are these stars arranged so neatly?"" I look up right away, As if it found out that it’s been discovered, it’s moved towards us, i saw this black triangle object moved from 1km to 100m in 4 seconds to right above my head then moved away in 10 seconds over the tree top. The lights appears to Disguised as stars at the beginning, then when it came close i found it's changed it’s light mode into very dim lights in a few seconds. It’s not like any of the earth-made lights being: No light rhyme, extremely even and consistent light, no flash, very stable.regular circles, not an astigmatism-like luminous object on earth. The object cause No sound or air disturbance or any of that,the Movement of that object is smooth and easy, not like any of the terrestrial craft that will cause interference or disturbance of the air. It's even more darker than the sky, Its material composition is not reflective like earth-made metals. for my recall it’s about About 50 metres long or even bigger.Its existence seemed deeper than the background sky, Its edges are so sharp, then I realised its weight and texture at that time, sort of mixed texture, very heavy.. i still recall the lights that appears has embedded on it, the surface of its triangular row is not a coating or something, but a non-reflective metal material. This makes it more incredible to move quickly and smoothly without resistance. On the rest of the journey after its appearance, I thought day and night that now I can still go back to the scene at that time, and all the details are so clearly visible. The most incredible detail I can recall now is that the light has no radiance, just like the light solidifies in it.

May 12, 2021, my girlfriend photographed a rainbow with an iPhone 10 in three consecutive photos (1 – 3). The last photograph (3.) captured a white oval shaped object. 
 
I have included the photos with their descriptions. 
 
Photo Information: 
1. First photo is of the rainbow, zoomed in. 
2. Second photo is of the rainbow, zoomed out. 
3. Third photo is of the rainbow, again zoomed in, but this time however the photo caught an oval shaped object at the top center of the image, which was not seen by the photographer at the time the photo was taken. It was seen only a couple of days later when I examined the photos. 
4. This is simply an enlargement of the oval shape with no adjustment to the color or contrast. It is interesting by the fact that it looks as if there is disturbance in the air above and around the object. 
5. The contrast is boosted in this image, as well I increased the DPI to reduce the pixelization to smooth it out. When I did this, I was expecting to see simply a white shape getting whiter. What really struck me were the colors that were hidden in the bleached-out whiteness of object in the original state. 
6. This photo has the contrast pushed almost to the maximum. 
 
I have no idea what this is, and I have never seen this kind of shape appearing in an iPhone 10 image before, assuming it could be a glitch in the picture. 
 
Assuming it is not a glitch, but an actual object, if I were to interpret the colors in photos 4, 5 And 6, I would say the first photo captured an object as it is falling, leaving a sort of wake in the air above it. 5 Looks like the bottom part of the object is heated up while the top is cooler. 6 is that concept visually enhanced. 
 
If there is further interest in this, I have the original, raw photos with the original metadata which I would be happy to share with you at your request. 
 
Thank you.

I continued videoing until the light on the end of the building next made a reflection in my videos so that's when I stopped videoing. At the start of video 2 you can hear my voice crack when I speak because I had no idea what I was seeing. Also the local airport is closely. When they depart or arrive they fly directly over my apartment building in a northeast to southwest direction. There is also a hospital south of me where there are medical helicopters taking patients to the trauma center. But this object was going southeast to northwest in direction. There is no need for an aircraft to go in this direction nor do I remember ever seeing anything flying in the direction because there just really isn't any reason to. I am a Navy veteran which doesn't mean I know everything about anything. But I know what I saw that night I have no explanation for. Also in the video you can clearly see the helicopter shining its spotlights over towards the object.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,,,

Sometime between August 5th - August 29th in 2021 my dad went down to the beach at our family camp to look at the stars. It was a beautiful clear and still night. We weren't down there for long when we saw a light that flew the entire sky from south to north out at our camp on Lake Superior at Horseshoe Bay in Ontario about 2-3 seconds. (We have a huge open view of the sky from the edge of the Lake). It was a white light like a plane. There was no noise. We both watched it and I said ""what was that?"" My dad said he didn't know but that whatever it was was ""dangling"" and that it must have been military. I said no way that was a UFO. We both remarked that we'd never seen anything like it before.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,,,

The sighting I am reporting happened on 19th August 2021 (Thursday). Time was around 6. 07 – 6. 10/11 am approx and the length of the observation could be around 3 – 4 mins. I was actually sitting in the plane - left side by a window. It was flight KL1350 from Prague to Amsterdam – regular route (the number of the flight could be different in 2021, the route is still being operated in 2022). 
 
My sighting started right away after we finished sharp ascend from the Václav Havel aiport above Prague and did turn to flight more northwestern direction. I remember checking flight route after incident at that time, but unfortunately I did not save any printscreens, but the turn is actually always done above nature protected area CHKO Krivoklátsko. 
 
Concretely plane flights over or very near village Bratronice and then continues to slightly turn near dam Klícava. I also noticed close by to Bratronice is ex rocket military base Bratronice (from information I did found, it is now used by people who like post apo). Closest airport would be the one marked as LKKL. 
 
We were not so hight yet around 1700 to 2000 meters at first, we were keep ascending, but slowly so by the end of observation we could above 3000 meters high. Because it was morning most people were actually trying to sleep. I had a good view to southwestern direction after this turn right after first ascend. The sunrise happened just minutes ago (found out it was 5. 58 am) before we took off so the sky was still red, pink and orange, but more light blue to western direction to the right of my window. 
 
That is when I noticed something black just above the clouds layer extremely far away to the very right of my window view. To my eyes it was just something black, I thought perhaps another airplane. But I took my pair of binoculars – 20x50 with me on my vacation as I intended to watch some birds there as well. 
 
I had it in small backpack I did not put into the locker over my head so I could reach it, the pair was under the seat in front of me. I quickly zoomed to see into far distance clearly and made sure I see one image with both eyes. Then I froze. 
 
I couldn’t believe what I am actually seeing. The first impression was what is even that?!!. There was vertically placed solid pitch black object which resembled to me some sort of a black pillar but with sharp squared edges it seemed - prism. When I first saw it, it was under for me so could see at least upper part which was sharply squared shaped. This object itself looked enormous. I think if I would imagine it in a horizontal position it would be close to length of the fuselage of the plane I was in. 
 
But what was protruding from it made me feel even more astonished. There were some kind of protrusions which I can only compare to tentacles of squid. These were moving in similar fashion to tentacles or those appendages of some bacteria if you look under microscope. Some of them were thinner some of them very thick. I was not able to count how many exactly are there, but they was some space in the air between them so it wasn’t countless number. 
 
Sometimes they interwined or crossed and then went back to sort of moving in the style mentioned before and hanging under the pillar/prism. Couple times the pillar/prism rectracted them inside into itself and they became invisible. They were retracted gradually, it wasn’t like they disappeared. 
They looked attached to the pillar/prism. The pillar/prism was hovering most of the time, it slightly went up not being right above the cloud layer anymore so the view for me was now 0° in the horizont, then it was moving rapidly to right and left and opposite while the „tentacles“ got risen up (check the sketch). 
 
Whole this object was completely black, but reflecting sun light. After couple minutes it started moving forward rapidly and keep ascending. It was getting smaller how the distance between me and it was becoming greater. At the end of the observation the angle could be °15 in the horizont. The pillar/prism never changed its shape and stayed in a vertical position it was very clear I am seeing a solid object. 
 
It disappeared in the distance at very far right side. There were no windows, holes on it. I didn’t see any marking of any other color. There was no sound but that could be because of the distance and the noise the plane was making. Cannot say if there was any weird odor or interference with electrical devices as this was very far away. 
 
I didn’t take any picture nor video of it. I looked through my phone quickly but couldn’t even see it at all. I didn’t allert any other people in the plane. I logically assumed some people could start to panic or behave unpredictably and the last thing I wanted was a cancelled flight returning to Prague and police coming for me. I have no idea if anyone else noticed, but I don’t think chance of anyone else being here and having a pair of binoculars with them is high and with naked eyes it wasn’t discernable at all. 
 
I talked about it only with couple of my friends. Some suggested unusually formed jet contrails but I did check pictures and videos of such phenomenon and can say they look like made from smoke which is something completely different from what I saw. Not even those protrusions were smoke like, they were totally black and with reflection of sun and moving more resembled liquid substance than smoke. Even the way these contrails move is different.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,,,

The balcony faces south and we had just photographed the sun setting in the west at 6:30pm. After the sun had gone down, yet still light, we were commenting on how dark and clear it was without any buildings or street lights for miles. We looked up and it was not yet totally dark. We commented on the amazing view and the distance we could see. There were no clouds in the sky, as my photos will show, and no stars were out yet. 
 
 My friend and I were looked out and saw 3 lights in the shape of a triangle right in front of us.  It was flashing, then 2 of the lights on one side stopped flashing then quickly disappeared. The one remaining light got brighter then went out completely. I saw nothing else in the sky. No planes, no stars, no clouds.

Driving through the neighborhood north/northwest we saw approximately two dozen lights, in formation, slowly descending. It’s possible the lights were connected to one craft or several different crafts in formation. They were similar to an isosceles triangle with a wide base and short sides. We also noticed what appeared to be several aircraft heading toward the object or near it. I made my girlfriend stop the car (in the middle of the road) so I could snap a photo. She, a pragmatist, could only explain the phenomenon as a “drone show”. I snapped a photo but failed to realize the flash was on, and the photo does not do the sighting justice.

It’s probably nothing but I’ve never seen anything like it. It looked like a shooting star at first but it lit up while sparking light green as if it were a fast-falling flare or a single firework. I realized it was a little less than 1000 feet away from me when it started sparkling. It continued to descend and stopped sparkling around 200 feet above the ground before disappearing completely. It seemed to ‘land’  (it was really fast and close to the ground when it stopped sparkling) on the farm property (not in the field) across the road from the dorm at Heart of Georgia Regional Airport. It made no sound whatsoever. 
 
 I was running some and I was taking a walk through the parking lot during recovery. It happened over the course of less than five seconds. There were was a group of people further into the parking lot when I was only at the mouth of the parking lot. (I will not be releasing names or contact info, sorry). 
 
 It’s probably a shooting star or something but I’ve always wanted to do one of these but never had a reason to do so. This is a real though, I’m not lying about what I’ve seen.

I was outside and was looking up at the stars, as it was very clear.  I suddenly almost overhead noticed a medium bright star and focused on it for a few seconds.  Suddenly it started moving to the right, at a slow speed, then stopped and came back to the previous position.  Made other movements in different directions, at quick and slow speeds.  At this time of night, it is a little to the northwest from being directly overhead of where we are standing. 
 
I told my daughter to look at it and see if it looked like it was moving to her. 
 
As we both watched it, it moved in a circular motion, stopped, then rather quickly moved to the left and came back to original position. 
 
I have looked most every night and it still does these crazy maneuvers, always in circles, diagonal, or right and left patterns, and it stays within a certain area. 
 
I have tried to figure if it's just me, but the fact that we've both seen it and watched it for several minutes is strange.

I’ve held onto this for a year now and I think about it every day. I needed to share in hopes to get it off my mind. 
 
I was car camping at the Greendale campground in the Green Mountain National Forest, a place I know well. I was listening to a podcast when my car started to shake. I thought it was a bear. It was almost as if an earthquake was happening. I quickly realize it was not a bear and got out of the car. The trees were moving, my car was moving, I felt it. Birds who were sleeping in trees now screamed. I have birds, their sounds were of being scared out of sleep, but so many, it gave me chills. I looked up and saw a large blimp like ship that was low, just above the tree line, it was like see through, it reflected the sky, it looked solid but not, it’s hard to explain. It was like stealthy I guess you could say, like a Star Trek ship cloaked. It made no noise and it moved slow. There was a power coming from it. Once it was over head it blow air on top of me, it was warm, like the engine was pushing out air. This is really hard to explain in words. I’ve had a lot of weird things happen in my life, I’ve seen my share of unexplained things, but this bothered me. It’s not like anything I’ve seen or heard of. All I can think of is it’s some kind of government ship being tested and I think that’s what bothers me most. 
 
I hope I explained myself well enough.

Summary: This incident happened about a year ago - the day could be off by 1 or 2 days. I live in Northeast Colorado Springs at just under 6,800 feet elevation. From my house I have pretty expansive views of the mountains to the west and the skies over Colorado Springs. I had just retired the week prior from my job as a test engineer for GPS satellite control software and was at home. At about 3:30pm I decided to walk around my backyard. It was still about an hour before it even started to get dark (sunset about 5pm), so I was surprised to see what looked like the evening star (Venus or Jupiter), but it was so early, the sun was still visible in the late afternoon. I thought to myself - this is the brightest I've ever seen the evening star appear in the daytime. (Later, about sunset, I saw the actual evening star and it was a different object - it was not visible at 3:30pm). 
The sky was mostly cloudy (I'd say 75% obscured by clouds), not the high wispy ones, but cumulus clouds that obscure the sky. There were openings in the sky between the clouds. I looked to the south and I saw this 'star'- from my location, this placed it about halfway between Peterson Space Force Base and Cheyenne Mountain Air Station. Its position didn't move - as the clouds would come and go moving from right (west) to left (east) the 'star' was still in the same place. After 5-10 minutes the shape changed; it started to get bigger, fade and disperse - it grew in size up to the size of the moon before dispersing. 
After another cloud break it was gone, but in its place was this cigar-shaped white object with a black bottom. I could see no wings or tail. It's possible that it could have been saucer-shaped if it was being seen from a side angle - I couldn't tell. It was not the much rounder tic-tac shape seen in other reported accounts. It appeared to me to be probably above 14,000 or 15,000 feet high because the clouds were also obscuring the upper portion of Pikes Peak, which is 14,115 feet. The clouds kept moving at a pretty good clip from west to east and would repeatedly hide/show the object. At one point, I could see a regular jet flying almost directly behind it from west to east because I could see its contrail - it appeared to be the normal very small size of a jet cruising at 35,000 feet. But this object was much bigger and so had to be much closer. I would say it was about the size of a commercial airplane fuselage as it would appear at 15,000 feet; however, it didn't move. For it to be a plane, it would have to have been flying directly into the wind at the exact same speed as the wind in order for it not to move - not likely in my opinion. 
I thought - what a perfect location in which to spy down on one side to see Cheyenne Mountain and the other side to spy down on Peterson. It was there for at least 5 minutes and Peterson didn't launch any fighter jets to chase it. (Most of the time I can hear those louder jets take off from Peterson, but I didn't hear any). Again, I thought this thing must be visible on Peterson's or NORAD's radars, so if they didn't chase this thing, it must either be 1) some kind of known military object or 2) other object not thought to be a threat; otherwise, they would have chased it or something. They didn't. Then after another cloud break, it was gone completely. I never saw it move - it just disappeared from its location.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,38.87714691753403,-104.76823722978384,POINT(-104.76823722978384 38.87714691753403)

Perceived through a hunch? 
 
I'm a freelance artist. Been living here for 30 years. A few military installations are nearby. Lots of C-130s. Back in '92, there was a mass sighting in my county. A police chase was the focal point of it. 
In the afternoon preceding these events, I was outside doing chores and having a smoke. The wind was powerful and was blowing a range of clouds all about. There's a clearing across from my home, andI was admiring the way the shadows were moving. Then, the shadows parted in such a way that it looked manufactured. I thought to myself, ""Man, seems like good cover for UFOs n such."" when the weather is wild. 
I went out to have a cigarette later that day. Facing North, I see some sort of aircraft rising at a steep angle, obscured by what trees remain from the housing developments. It turns left, heading south. It remained hard to make out until it passed out of my periphery; lots of trees. It was indeed triangular in shape. No sound, no lights, same color as the sky. A mix of streetlights and moonlight. Crystal clear night. 
I went inside to get mittens and returned moments later. I lit another cigarette and gazed up at a satellite that happened to cut right along my roofline. Totally normal, save for the orange ball bouncing about it. It felt playful; mocking the satellite it seemed. 
Those two events took about 20 minutes. No more than 10 more minutes pass when I see a brilliant white light coming from the East way above me heading West. Then, it dropped suddenly, hundreds if not thousands of feet until it was tugged back upwards, as if on a fishing line. It began to bob and drift out in front of me(facing North). It was triangular in form, one prominent strobing light on the ""back"" of it. Like a game of Pong, bouncing back and forth. The shape of the craft was triangular, reminiscent of a futuristic race car to me. I could perceive no sound. It drifted off back East, and up a forested hill. 
The next night, 2 AM. I'm having a smoke. I gaze up to the left. I see the shade of an aircraft, one red and one white light. I think nothing of it. That is until the lights jettisoned off in opposite directions, and the craft carrying on through the dark.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,41.23445042372881,-80.77760211864407,POINT(-80.77760211864407 41.23445042372881)

It was late in the afternoon, the sun had set when I saw this bright object flying low at a slow pace. There is an airport near my neighborhood, so I suspected it was an airplane getting ready to land. Upon closer inspection I realized that the object flying above was not making any noise/sound of any kind. When the object got closer it became obvious it was not a plane. I procured my phone from my pocket to take a picture of it. As I snapped a picture of the object it appeared to have stopped moving. I was surprised by this and then tried to get a second picture of it while it was motionless above me, but my phone started to glitch. In my haste to take another picture I started to just tap at random on my phone hoping to catch what I was seeing. I saw the object come to a complete stop and it became brighter then quickly turned in an upwards position and flew away. It arched up and over flying away from me; then suddenly before it was completely out of sight it turned sharply to the left and disappeared. Leaving an orange/yellow tail behind in its wake. The whole incident took about 1-2 minutes. This was not the first time I had seen this orb of light before, although it was the first time I was able to take a photo of it. I hadn't realized there was a video of it until I looked over my phone pics and became aware that I must of hit the video button in my haste by mistake.

As we drove home to Fort Dodge Iowa from Webster city Iowa, i noticed what I initially thought was a star. But a star I'd never seen in the night sky before (I'm very familiar with the night sky as I've always wanted to be an astrophysicist or aerospace engineer). And as we drove, I realized that the object was moving slowly across the sky. The object was fairly large, and very, very bright. Bright enough to outshine all but maybe one star in the sky. I told my girlfriend to take a left, and go west down a gravel road. When she did, I told her to stop the car and see if I could get a video of the object. In the video, I held the camera still enough to be able to see it move across the sky. I was paying attention to my screen to ensure a good video, but then I realized I might get better quality if I taped it in the raw camera mode on my phone. So I had stopped the video, switched to raw, and pointed my phone back at the sky. To my surprise, the bright object had seemingly vanished from the sky. That's when I wondered, if maybe I had captured it disappearing on my initial video. When I went and watched, during the last maybe 4 or 5 seconds of the video, you can watch it completely vanish. Before I zoom out, you see it flicker slightly a few times, and when I zoom out, maybe a second before the video ends, you watch the light suddenly go dark, and the object dissappear from view. From what I have seen of satellites, this was way too bright, and was moving way too fast to be an ordinary satellite. I had looked up to see if there were any known comets (even though one that size would have a large tail), or maybe some other sort of astronomical event happening. But my search resulted in nothing but blanks. I didn't know who exactly I could tell, or show my video to. Then I saw an article, with a link to this site. So, I felt like I should tell my story with you all, and maybe even the public should you deem it as significant enough.

I had my phone out taking pictures of some cool storm clouds. Then saw the first two lights, the third quickly joined the other two lights in a triangle formation. The third light to join was moving erratically amongst the other two in a somewhat horizontal pattern. Once stablish the top right (top right in the formation) started flashing, as if it was signaling the other lights. After a few flashes the first light flew off, above (I think) the mountain range and disappeared. Then the light started flashing in a different sequence (seemed like the flashes slowed down) and seemed to be signaling to the bottom light, which then proceeded to fall towards the ground.

To have witnessed this object here struck me as odd. I'm located on the approach path of Manchester Airport however, any aircraft land or taking off do so from a north to south south to north direction. 
I live in a very quiet suburb of Stockport and can normally hear aircraft even at cruising altitude. What I witnessed was deadly silent. The craft moved from an East to West direction, arcing slightly at the beginning of the video. You can get a bit of a prospective from a star near the object. It levelled out, still moving very slowly. As the video nears the end, you can get a little more of a prospective from the rooftop of my house. 
I can only describe that 
The light that was emitted was like that of a disco ball many many different colours. I noticed this as I zoomed in. What really got my heart pounding the most wasn't so much the sighting, but the feeling I got a few seconds before I noticed the object. As I was sat facing the opposite direction looking towards my garden I had a feeling of something like an Aura around where I was sitting. Not so much an Aura around my immediate body, but a shield or a ball. A little like the inflatable balls you can climb inside. The moment I felt this ""Aura/Shield"" I turned in the exact direction of where the object/craft was located. It was almost like I was meant to turn at that precise moment. I'm 100% certain this was NOT an aeroplane. 
Also Around the time of this sighting, I heard nor saw any aircraft landing or taking off. 
I am quite sure that Manchester Airport is normally busy around around this time of year. 
I'm not entirely sure the video evidence has uploaded properly! so

Generally, each morning my husband and I sit in our front living room having coffee and he reads aloud to me from a large book of philosophy that we study and discuss. We have many large windows in that room, and I am able to birdwatch and enjoy my coffee while he reads. The sighting I am reporting was on a morning with normal weather, although not particularly bright or dark and overcast – nothing out of the ordinary. It was mid-morning and broad daylight. My street runs north and south, and we live on a high hill overlooking much of the neighborhood to the east. We were both seated on a couch by the front windows that face east. I am used to seeing aircraft from the local airport (Michiana Regional) passing over at higher levels and we have also seen helicopters, fighter jets on Notre Dame game days, and of course birds flying over. We have eagles and hawks living nearby that we sight regularly. What I saw was like nothing I have ever seen before, and I have found no pictures online that match anything like what I saw to help me describe it to you. The object I saw was flying much lower than any aircraft I have seen before but it was flying over the treetops of even the tall trees in my yard. I would guess the object was flying at about 300-500 feet above ground at about the same distance from my house to the east, perhaps more, but it definitely was flying between my street and Ironwood Road to the east – which is 3-4 blocks away. The object was rectangular in shape (it reminded me of a cell phone, only double in thickness but about the same ratio in length and width). My guess is that its size was at least 50 feet long, 20-25 feet wide, and 8-10 feet thick. The object was flying straight south to north; however, it was rotating in a rather slow and steady controlled flat spin. I noticed the spin by the reflection of light moving on the object's southern edge. The object was medium gray in color, metallic in consistency, with no visible windows, or lights observed. I did not hear any sound associated with the object – nothing other than normal household noise such as the air-conditioner, refrigerator, etc. I cannot figure out by what method it was flying. Propulsion couldn't have been the means because it was rotating. It had no blades like a helicopter or any type of protrusions on any side because I saw all 4 sides of it as it passed and rotated. I think it took at least a second for each side to turn away from me. I'm not sure, but I think the object was rotating in a counterclockwise manner. Of course, it happened so fast, and I was stunned trying to figure out what I was looking at so by the time I could say anything to my husband the object had gone out of view behind the large tree in our neighbor's front yard. He did not witness it. I texted my little brother who is in the Air Force and he said he didn't know of any military equipment like what I was describing. My father was very ill at the time, I was focused on that, and I didn't know anyone to report it to – it didn't seem appropriate to report to the police, so I decided to forget about it. Obviously, something like that is hard to forget about, and today a friend visited who works in air-traffic control who recommended this sight to report my experience.

The object was traveling from the South end of town, then pivoted and traveled east towards Lake Superior.  It was moving fast, covering a large geographical area in less than 30 seconds.

Sunday 20 October-about 18:42/Superstition Mts.    I heard a VERY loud roaring overhead.   Ran outside into the backyard just in time to see blinking red lights moving off into the NW.   I did NOT see the shape or outline of a craft.   Then i ran thru the house into the front yard.  Moving off into the NW I watched red lights blinking in a ""V form"";  first the R side would blink 3 red lights at a 45d angle (consecutively - not simultaneously) then the L side would blink 3 red lights at a 45d angle.   I watched the blinking lights for about 3 minutes to get an idea of the 'shape'.   The only reason i am reporting a 'V' form is due to the angle line of the blinking lights.

Was outside looking up at the night sky to catch some of the Orionid meteors.  A faint light caught my eye, which resembled a satellite or the ISS going over except for the it's motion and intermediate visibility. 
 
 Another person watching the sky with me confirmed what I saw. 
 
 The object moved in one general direction, but in 2-3 second bursts (fading quickly to nothing) and kind of turned in a short arc to the left, before fading, then turning in a short arc to the right, then fading.  It kept a consistent rhythm with this motion, but upon reappearing was back in the straight path of travel before turning once again off course. 
 
 My initial thought was that an airplane may be going overhead and we were seeing a left wing indicator, followed by the right wing indicator, but the obvious arc motion the object made upon each burst of light really couldn't have been possible if it was only the tip of an airplane wing.  I've also never seen an airplane travel in that path before. 
 
 The object was in view for 45 - 60 seconds as it crossed the sky.  Appeared to be a white/bright blue colored light.

Personal Background: 
Served in the Air Force for several years where I worked on various fighters, and deployed with them. I've heard all types of airframe flying insanely fast on station and while deployed, but nothing in my years of service topped how fast, and how mind blowing quiet this ""thing"" flew at the altitude it was at (just above the mountains). 
 
Abnormalities: 
1) An aircraft that would have been flying the direction this ""light"" was, would have had a red light on the left wing, and green light on the right wing. Even the F-35 which is stationed at Hill AFB is designed this way, and is not uncommon to see/hear them flying around clear as day in the night time. The wing tip lights are small, bright, and distinguishable, but this ""light"" was circular, only green, had an odd glare to it, and was fairly large. 
 
2) In between flashes we could not see anything at all, and only knew something was there by the flashing green light. The ""light"" was flying above the mountains to the East of us, and had the back drop of the sky, so we should have been able to see something. 
 
3) I checked flight radars that night, and the only thing that was flying remotely close was a Cessna that we could see flying towards Ben Lomond Peak, and had a flight path going towards Wyoming. 
 
4) I checked Hill AFB website, and the only flights scheduled were for several F-35s that were supposed to fly over Utah on 3 July the day prior.",2022-12-22T00:00:00,41.23240188679245,-111.97078092243189,POINT(-111.97078092243187 41.23240188679245)

Because we are so close to the airport And in a big city I already knew the changes were slim. We are quite used to all of the airplane traffic that is constantly buzzing over our skies - and can very easily identify planes and helicopters etc. 
 
Around 1:06AM I went to the backyard to have a seat and check around for some shooting stars - while gazing at the east direction near Orion’s Belt and clear where incoming planes come to land I saw a bright elongated vertical shaped light.  I immediately thought it was wierd bc it was not moving and atill changing form.  I watched it for a few minutes before it’s shaped turned more circular -and moving lights.  Rapidly moving lights.

The object was triangular and had bright lights underneath, with three red lights. It appeared to hover for awhile over Lake Nosbonsing before slowly moving across the lake towards land. It was a large craft and it was flying much too low to the ground to be an airplane. As it flew over us, it wasn’t as loud as you would expect it to be and it made an odd noise (you could hear a rumble, but more of a whirling noise). As it passed over our home, it seemed to pick up speed and move off quickly into the distance towards Ottawa. 
 
I captured a number of pictures of it (in one it actually looks oval and in the other, its shape looks different). 
 
My son was the other witness to it. He is a full-time Criminal Justice student and I am a respected high school teacher with twenty-two years experience.

Leaving for work early on Saturday I left my front door and immediately noticed there were much more stars out than normal (maybe 25-40 more) which drew my attention to the sky. I realized not only were there more stars but they were moving erratically back and forth for 2-3 seconds. They drew in closer and then almost instantaneously they formed into a straight line and started moving from the southwest sky towards the Big Dipper (northwest) like a conveyer belt. It reminded me how traffic would look on a freeway in a single lane. They were not equal distance Sparta and moved each at different speedsI tried to keep count but there was more appearing from what looked like nowhere. At least 70-100 total continuously headed toward the Big Dipper and then disappeared into the sky. It took up the entire span of the sky and lasted for 5 minutes. I could tell this was fat and not in our atmosphere. I woke my wife up to see the event as well. After roughly 8-10 min! utes the event ended and I could no longer see anything.
